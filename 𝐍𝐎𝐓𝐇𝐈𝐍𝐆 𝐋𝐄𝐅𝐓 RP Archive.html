 who is considered an enigma has a sense of mystery that oozes out of

the exact description of Cho. Ever since this outbreak began, he lost 
everyone that he ever loved. People always told him that he was quiet 
before all this, so now having lost the people he has, he is practically
 silent. His expression will almost never shift, and his eyes are always
 empty. He prefers to be alone as he can’t trust anyone, but he doesn’t 
even know if he can trust himself anymore. This guy is a hard one to

use it once, that one time took a desperate toll on her mental stability

 virus airborne? She can never be sure, so she wears a gas mask. Is it

mental state degrading. But she can't trust anyone either. What if 
they're infected? What if they bite her the moment she turns her back?

 swift breeze brushed her dark locks across her pale, fair skin. The 
wind was warm and the sun highlighted the ruins of the city. Daiyu took 
in a deep breath, standing just outside the door. No zombies in sight. 
It was peaceful, but impending. So she turned away, diving deeper into 
the store. Her brown boots brushed debris across the aisle floors. She 
was hoping for something of use, but the place was swept clean. She 
groaned as she raked her slim fingers through her hair.</p><p class="center">Daiyu
 continued to scan the shelves. Until she found nothing in the end. She 
bit her cheek in irritation before scurrying behind the register. Often,
 convenient stores had a hidden cupboard on their back walls. Daiyu 
quickly tore off posters, looking for the hidden cabinet. And with luck,
 she found the the small square door and opened the latch. Within it, 
few rolls of coins, cash, and a pack of cigarettes. The cigarettes were 
useful, as she could use them for survival purposes at her camp in the 
woods. The coins, she could opt for a noise trap. However the money, she
 had no use for. Although, she would find one. Daiyu brushed her hair 
out of her face before stuffing all the supplies into her knitted 
backpack. She should start making her way back. After all, Daiyu could 
not go on for long. She was weak when it came to her endurance and 
strength. And being alone, it was hard to do anything when her physical 
capabilities are her own obstacle.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message from-me"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/1e56d3cef4a4e6a52303bffe4865a7163cab8169r1-1877-2048v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><!----> <div class="message-content"><div class="text-msg rich-content"><p>(Indeed.)</p></div> <!----></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/6e7ab16d6255f197db66ee566f7198cbf208a6b3r1-1242-1248v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 wandering, whatever, she was just avoiding people in general. She felt 
her hand get licked by a big, wet doggy tongue. Good Ol' Bean, always by
 her side, she smiled at him and Bean returned the affection with a 
small bark. Without him, Riley was sure she would have died from sheer 
lonlieness by now. She was in the city now, chance of there being non 
infecteds around was pretty high then. Just in case though, she kept her
 hand close to the holster of the gun, ready to whip it out at the sign 
of trouble. Even if something did happen, she would very likely not be 
able to bring herself to pull the trigger, her conscience wouldn't let 
her, she'd need to learn how to tune it out. Not get rid of it 
completely, after all it was the only thing that differentiated a human 
from the common beast, but just to be able to switch it on and off, like
 a light switch. Off, BAM, gunshot then back on later after leaving the 
vicinity of the body. 'Easier said than done though', she said to 
herself, still daydreaming.</p><p>Even in this state between imagination
 and reality, Riley heard rustling coming from the nearby convenience 
store and decided to do a lil investigation, hand near her pistol, just 
in case!</p><p>"Hello? Anyone there?"

 Ellie pointed the rusted metal pipe at the woman sat on the floor in 
front of her. The sun shone down into the alleyway, casting a warm glow 
on both the survivors' faces – quite the opposite of the brutal actions 
they had unleashed on each other earlier. Those actions showed in the 
blood splattered across Ellie and blood leaking through her white tank 
top from the small gash across her stomach, and the opposite woman's 
broken arm.</p><p class="center"> “You have one more chance. One last 
fucking chance,” Ellie spit down at the girl as her gaze flickered from 
side to side. Since they were out and in the open, they were vulnerable 
and exposed to an attack. Ellie’s hardened green gaze looked back down 
to the woman as she let out a feeble cough, “I'm not giving up my 
friend.”</p><p class="center"> Ellie felt her breathing become deeper as
 her eyebrows furrowed. Her jaw clenched and her hands curled into fists
 as her grip on the pipe tightened. With one swift move, Ellie hit the 
girl over the head with the pipe. Again. And again. Blood splashed onto 
her face but she took no notice, hitting and beating the woman opposite 
her until she finally, in a raspy and exhausted voice, told her where 
her father’s murderer was.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/49ad10c99571679d901a5499ca217f6779080aebr1-500-750_68.gif" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 Ellie tossed the pipe to one side carelessly and stared at the bloody 
heap of meat in front of her. She took out her father’s revolver, double
 checked her bullets and then turned and walked out of the alleyway as 
if nothing had happened. This is what the cruel, apathetic world had 
done to her. She was completely desensitised. Ellie was not willing to 
show the woman mercy by putting a bullet through her skull and putting 
her out of her pain. In fact, she would have loved to watch her suffer 
until her least breath but she had to get moving. She didn't know when 
her father’s murderer – Abby – would move from her current position. Her
 only thought was making Abby pay. Ellie wanted to spill blood, and she 
always, always got what she wanted.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message info-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="linkblue">

racing. She wasn’t in a good position. Fighting against another human

she would move around the register countertop to avoid meeting the

solace in it, but right now all she needed was a sound. Even a peep

 ground. Anyone would think he was dead but dead he was not. He was 
behing the cashier counter, slowly and groggligly crawling up to a wake.
 His head was bleeding and he was having a bit of a hard time gaining 
his bearings. "Huh... I suppose they weren't so happy." He'd mutter to 
himself but smiling.</p><p class="center italic">Just the night before. He ended up in an altercation with a group of survivors, and it ended up with his beating.</p><p class="center">"Just
 as expected..." He was half dazed. The man sure was lucky to not have 
any zombies nearby but he would've been probally just as unaware to 
anyone else. The man grabbed a roll of bandages from his pocket,

needed first aid.</p></div> <!----></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/fd1a1d17e9c68c4c98a31cb6274a284bf3c3ad43r1-828-957v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 Ellie fiddled with her father’s revolver as she jogged down the street,
 mumbling the words ’Abby’ and ’kill’ to herself, almost like she was 
insane. Maybe she was insane. Her father had been brutally beaten and 
killed in front of her whilst she had been pinned down, forced to watch 
the terrible event.</p><p class="center"> The girl knew she should try 
and move past it, but she also knew if she had been murdered her father 
would have already killed her murderer. Ellie also knew that she should 
stay focused and alert, but she couldn't shake the thoughts of Joel’s – 
her father’s – death out of her mind. She didn't even notice she had 
kicked a can and sent it flying around the corner until she turned that 
corner and a crowbar came flying at her face.</p><p class="center"> 
Ellie, in surprise, dropped her gun as she raised her hands to defend 
herself. She managed to dodge the assault just in time and she 
immediately shoved her attacker away from her. She scrambled forward and
 snatched up her revolver, cocking it and pointing it at her attacker.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/6a448ed29b1ef6541ce920ba348924e736ae2d62r1-469-480_68.gif" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 Whoever that stranger was, they were fast, she only caught a glimpse of
 someone darting towards and through the door. Well, at least that 
confirmed they were human and they didn't try to attack her, something 
she was grateful for. She wouldn't chase after them, that'd only be 
askinb for trouble, so instead she settled for looking around the store 
for any supplies. The shelves had been positively stripped of any useful
 essentials, save for a stray candy bar and a small water bottle. Riley 
pocketed the candy bar and opened the water bottle then poured some into
 Bean's mouth before taking a sip herself and putting it in her bag. 
'Heh,' she thought 'Who needs other people when you can have such a 
loyal pupper as Bean? Not me, thats for sure.' She giggled to herself. 
Wait, wait one lil momento! Something felt off, she just couldn't quite 
put her finger on it.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="timestamp">

 The young male trotted down what used to be a sidewalk. It was 
overgrown with growing and dead plants. Almost every time he looked down
 at the path, there was bound to be at least four different cracks on 
each block. He looked up in the sky, and sighed. The warm breeze felt 
welcoming to him, and it moved his hair position in a sense after the 
light breeze stopped flowing. Noah heard something, and paused a moment 
to listen in. He just as curious as he was scared. Though, he didn't 
stop there. He put his hand on his side, where a newly sharpened dagger 
was at. He found the weapon long ago, and usually sharpened it on the 
regular. The melee weapon was sitting inside a small pouch type thing 
that was made out of leather. It has something carved into it, but he 
didn't bother to read it. He started walking slowly, and the little 
breeze made a bit of blood on his clothing move around.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message info-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="linkblue">

 Riley inspected the rest of the shop with a mild disinterest, that run 
in with a fellow human had been a curious experience, though a helpful 
one. From what she could glean, people were still distrustful of one 
another, fine by her. The less need to talk, the better, after all Bean 
was her comfort buddy, lil sibling and protecter all at once! Shd still 
fondly remebered the day when they had met, she'd only been 8 or so when
 she had gotten lost and ended up in a warehouse, inside the warehouse 
there happened to be a walker. Being little, she had been unable to 
defend herself, but then all of a sudden, like a guardian angel, Bean 
leaped from one of the boxes and pounced onto the walker, smashing its 
head in. When her parents found her, she was playfully tickling a very 
happy Bean. She nuzzled the sweet, golden dog, vowing for the umpteenth 
time to protect him with her life.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/6970706cf5f1a6b569f8a876f497e6348549706fr1-500-500v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 as she reached the main dining room, she spotted two figures at the 
door. Her skin grew pale and her body shook with fright. Just in front 
of her, two stalkers turned to meet her eyes. They were known to be 
aggressive up close. Her skin raised goosebumps, and she sprinted 
without a second thought. Her goal that day was to find a vehicle 
somehow. However with no luck she had found none functional. And now, 
her goal was to survive.</p><p class="center">Daiyu breached another 
door before closing it behind her. She found herself in an alleyway, her
 breathing heavy and her gun in her hand. “Ah... such a beautiful day.” 
She spoke to herself, looking up to see the endless blue between two 
tall, ruined buildings. “Perhaps if i survive it, the sun will flourish 
better tomorrow.” She mumbled, closing her eyes for a split second. 
Daiyu bit her bottom lip, trying to steady her breathing and not letting
 her tears fall. She was overwhelmed. It looked like she was smiling, 
yet the single tear that escaped and fell down her cheek proved 
otherwise. Daiyu was scared, lonely, and somehow content. Perhaps it was
 the fact that she was having such a peaceful, achievable feeling in a 
place filled with horrors and constant death. She had almost just died, 
and yet she had survived. Near death experiences are normal, but the 
overwhelming feeling that comes after doesn’t get easier.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="timestamp">

 Ellie stared at the man for a few minutes as her breathing grew deeper.
 She was trying as hard as possible not to keel over from the gash in 
her side. She hoped that the person opposite her could not tell that she
 was bleeding because of the blood of the girl earlier still fresh on 
her clothes.</p><p class="center"> She kept the gun pointed at the man 
opposite her and narrowed her hateful green eyes at him. “You know an 
Abby?” She asked. This man seemed far from somebody who would be hanging
 around with her father's murderer or the girl from earlier. They were 
fierce, strong and smart. Ellie had no doubt that this man could do the 
same and that's why she kept her gun on him, but he seemed so timed at 
this moment. “Did an Abby come through here?” She asked once more.</p><p class="center"> ((sorry that this sucks i just woke up lol-))</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/f03e3728f669d2e8fdfb9c11ce5ae95f793ae3car1-199-253v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 city was large, albeit peaceful. Atleast as peaceful a city full of 
mumbling and bumbling zombies could be. The ambience was the breezes of 
the wind blowing past the large and tall buildings; many which were 
rotting or torn. As if the place had tornados rush through in a hurry. 
Of course, there was the ocassional gunshot or rarer screams but such 
was a normal life here.</p><p class="center italic">Such was a normal life for twenty six years.</p><p class="center">In
 this city, there was one particular corner store. It was once a family 
owned store and probably had housed once a happy family but now was 
mostly remnants of memories and shelves nearly empty from goods that 
were stolen.</p><p class="center">There was a man laying bloodied on the
 ground. Anyone would think he was dead but dead he was not. He was 
behing the cashier counter, slowly and groggligly crawling up to a wake.
 His head was bleeding and he was having a bit of a hard time gaining 
his bearings. "Huh... I suppose they weren't so happy." He'd mutter to 
himself but smiling.</p><p class="center italic">Just the night before. He ended up in an altercation with a group of survivors, and it ended up with his beating.</p><p class="center">"Just
 as expected..." He was half dazed. The man sure was lucky to not have 
any zombies nearby but he would've been probally just as unaware to 
anyone else. The man grabbed a roll of bandages from his pocket, 
wrapping them carefully around his head and providing himself some well 
needed first aid.</p></div> <!----></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/6a448ed29b1ef6541ce920ba348924e736ae2d62r1-469-480_68.gif" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 After having to practically wrestle Bean off of her, she and the big, 
cuddly labrador set off to find others. Not to talk to, just to 
*observe*. She wasn't much of a people person but wouldn't kill anyone, 
unless of course they attacked her or Bean first. Even then she would 
aim to disarm, not to kill or injure. There was another shop here, there
 seemed to be many, remmenants of a normal life now long lost. She 
laughed, funny word was Remmenants, it was her last name after all. It 
was a name quite fitting for a lone survivor she thought.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="timestamp">

 He managed to gain what bearings he had on his senses. The man leaned

 was quiet, luckily so. Although there was one zombie that was nearby. 
Of course, he was always properly equipped. He reached down for his

 sneaking away would have beem the best option. It was a little too late
 for that and the zombie turned around, probably smelling the blood from
 Ryuto's poor bandaging job. The feral zombie then broke into a run at 
the man, a runner of all things. Ryuto skipped back, sending a powerful 
kick into the zombie's hip with his steel toes to hopefully bide some 
time. The zombie collapsed for a moment and he used that very moment to 
start running now with an angry zombie a couple ten feet away from him.</p></div> <!----></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/49ad10c99571679d901a5499ca217f6779080aebr1-500-750_68.gif" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 He stared at the man, jumping when the man lunches at him, he 
instinctively snapped his dagger open, stumbling backward when the man 
let him go. He straightened himself, holding the dagger out just 
in-case. He let out a fake chuckle, shaking his head. "Cocky I see?" He 
blinked, letting out a slightly-shaky sigh. He stared at the man, 
rolling his eyes. He slid the dull side along his neck, sneering at the 
man. "Let's just get this over with.." He said in dismay, snapping the 
knife closed.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message from-me"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/1e56d3cef4a4e6a52303bffe4865a7163cab8169r1-1877-2048v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><!----> <div class="message-content"><div class="text-msg rich-content"><p>(That'd work.</p></div> <!----></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/fd1a1d17e9c68c4c98a31cb6274a284bf3c3ad43r1-828-957v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

or not. I'm not going to let you go that easily. You're the first human 
being i've seen in forever. Ever since my parents died when I was small,
 I've been on my own. Seeing another human has brought back my faith. If
 you leave, you won't be leaving alive." He said, pointing at the 
presumingly young boy with his dagger.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/49ad10c99571679d901a5499ca217f6779080aebr1-500-750_68.gif" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

mud and blood on his clothes masked anything he could use to sense one 
if those creatures nearby. He huffed, following the man slowly, his gaze

 it was nice to just sit there and watch the sky. The soft puffy clouds 
drifted across the sky. They would sit atop a rooftop, the beaming sun 
rays shined down on their shoulders and their face. Soon they stood up 
from their spot on the top, starting to climb down. There was only so 
long you can sit there, and just forget about everything. Over their 
shoulder was a bag; inside was water, food, a flashlight, a couple maps,
 and occasional stuff that they had picked up on their travels. Casey 
would brush themselves off from the shirt and the pants. They knew they 
should go off and find people, that just seemed to be the only thing 
that really kept them going. Casey would creep quietly across the the 
sidewalk; their feet gently tapping upon the cement, their fingers 
running through their curly locks of black hair. On the top of their 
head was a pair of goggles, sometimes they would wear them, to either 
prevent infection or hide their face.</p><p class="center">Casey paused a
 moment, feeling the warmth of the sun once again, uncertain where they 
should head from there. They carried various weapons with them; although
 they knew never use fatal swipes at humans, even if they tried it on 
them.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/49ad10c99571679d901a5499ca217f6779080aebr1-500-750_68.gif" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 He turned around, seeing the blood run down the males hand. "Are you an
 idiot?" He said, huffing his words. He walked up to him, and put his 
hand on his forehead, then ran his fingers through his dirty brown hair.
 "Don't let anymore of that bleed, don't be dumb and get it infected." 
He said, in a stressed tone. He looked back behind him, seeing nothing

 “And let you get away? I don’t think so!” Ellie hissed at Ezra. He was 
trying to distract her, so that he could hurt her or run away. He must 
be working with Abby. Of fucking course he was. How else would he know 
Abby?! Ellie was about to put a bullet through Ezra’s skull when a man, a
 different one, came barrelling towards them. He tripped and went flying
 onto the ground, shortly followed by a Runner.</p><p class="center"> 
Ellie jumped backwards and her arms dropped to her sides, her position 
vulnerable and easy to be taken advantage of. Ezra killed the Infected 
with two swings of his crowbar and Ellie forced herself to regain her 
senses.</p><p class="center"> She quickly slipped her revolver into the 
holster she had secured onto her thigh and pulled out a shotgun from her
 backpack. Her backpack was quite a big one as it held not only her 
other weapons – bow and arrows, a silenced submachine gun and a machete –
 but also food, materials and explosives. She always kept a small slit 
in her backpack open so that she could easily swap between weapons in 
combat.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/49ad10c99571679d901a5499ca217f6779080aebr1-500-750_68.gif" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 seems his gamble paid off. The male survivor had taken out one of the 
zombie who's skull cracked and splintered, sending shards of broken 
white skull fragments and rotten brain tissue onto the ground with a 
splat. The crowbar although didn't do the same kind of damage to the 
other, it did clip it's head. Ryuto then spun around, sending a kick 
into it's head.</p><p class="center">His kick alone didn't kill the 
second but once the zombie's head bashed into the concrete; between 
steel toes and an asphalt ground. It's head had no choice but to become 
rotten sandwhich.</p><p class="center italic">"You have my thanks-" 
Ryuto pulled himself up, thinking that was it but now a girl with a gun 
had a barrel pointed at him and the other male.</p><p class="center">He 
didn't move but he was calm. "Now how'd you get yourself into a 
situation like this?" He whispered to Ezra before turning to Ellie. 
Although he was just thrown into this situation, a collection of context
 clues gave him an idea. Those being the deluded ravings of the girl, 
her mention of Abby, and seeming seething anger under those words. 
"Alright hold up, I don't know this guy but Abby? I sure do." He half 
lied.</p><p class="center">He pointed at his own bloody bandages which

 He turned around, seeing the blood run down the males hand. "Are you an
 idiot?" He said, huffing his words. He walked up to him, and put his 
hand on his forehead, then ran his fingers through his dirty brown hair.
 "Don't let anymore of that bleed, don't be dumb and get it infected." 
He said, in a stressed tone. He looked back behind him, seeing nothing 
other than overgrown plants taking over homes. He turned back at the 
male, looking at his hand once more.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/60471444550bd56c75b30e26d1cf8ac8e947c350r1-1440-1486v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 the sun shone barely into the broken and covered windows of the old 
building, it looked almost to the point of breaking in and collapsing, 
yet it still stood strong in the broad daylight. loud noises of growling
 and gruntinf came from withing the walls and halls, the sounds followed
 by a loud patter of boots on the broken glass and wooden floor. the 
steps were even and long, well of course, he was a athelete, he ran 
longer than this, but the mask he wore really restricted his breathing. 
long legs outstretching as he took long strides in his running, a couple
 of runners right at his tail as he huffed in annoyance, he wasn't 
equipped with the delicacy of a full gun or two, only his wired bat and 
trusty matchete along with a useless empty hand-gun. the whole point 
into entering this building was to search for ammo against these 
monsters, yet he was only attacked by even more.</p><p class="center"> 
he passed by broken windows in a quickened pace, gainaing some distance 
with the runners behind him, not daring to look back to see how far he 
was in order not to trip on glass or fallen planks or doors. the whole 
building was an apartment one, he hoped it was uncleared, but now he 
really wished it was, the search had been ruined. the spores of fallen 
wafting the halls was unbearable, he had entered the building so 
carelessly he almost took a good whiff of them. glad he kept in a breath
 to put on his mask. fists tight, clenched harshly to the point his 
knuckles turned white from the force as he willed his aching chest to 
keep on a bit longer. the entrance was right there, he had entered 
through a balcony on the first floor  glad he hadn't ventured far enough
 to advance to the second floor. wondering how old this building really 
was to contain runners.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/b6766a90fe83c919d765e25e25bbc99cad8ff33dr1-1080-1080v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 upon reaching the balcony he wasted no time, willing his legs to 
propell him forward, head first over the balcony railing just so he 
could tumble onto the ground a bit below it. a loud grunt leaving him as
 he rose to his feet hurriedly, almost falling forward once more, 
finally glancing back to see the runners fall over the metal railing, 
falling onto the ground in weird places, hearing a crack here or there 
as the piled before getting up once more. he laughed lightly, bright 
green eyes wide at the sight before he turned around, feeling tightness 
around his left shoulder, probably had dislocated it. scolding himself 
in his mind for doing such a rash decision, yet he didn't find the need 
to get mauled by those things.</p><p class="center"> the male kept on 
running, keeping his left arm still at his ribs, feeling the pain seep 
in after the adrenaline died down the moment he ducked into an store he 
and Angel had set a temporary camp in. they were located mainly on the 
outskirts, traveling around the center to see if the shops and buildings
 had already been searched. and Vanya after finally finding an apartment
 building not searched, had jinxed it all. well by now he might aswell 
cleared the first floor of the things, glad he hadn't died in the 
process.</p><p class="center"> raising his good hand, he unclipped the 
mask from his head, letting it fall down onto his lap as he sat, plump 
lips parted to breathe in the fresh air, finally. his chest rose up and 
down along with his rapid breathing, he really needed to not get into 
situations like these. hoping that Angel was okay whilst she was on her 
side of the scavenger hunt.</p><p class="italic center"> " Never in my life, had i ran quicker. "</p><p class="center">
 he commented zo himself  letting out a breathy chuckle right after, 
wincing at zhe lightest movement of his left arm or shoulder. yup, 
definitely dislocated it.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/60471444550bd56c75b30e26d1cf8ac8e947c350r1-1440-1486v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 Casey’s eyes moved towards their feet, taking one step in front of the 
other. Although the destruction and mayhem around them, they found 
themselves taking moments to enjoy too few things in life. The small 
cracks in the pavement were plants peaked out of them, it was odd but 
almost calming. How life can breakthrough, and become stronger. They 
would look over to see what seemed like another person, taking out the 
undead. Their eyes would widen with curiosity as they hide behind a 
parked car, merely watching. They had no intention of hurting them, 
although it was uncertain whether they would converse with the person, 
they seemed to be able to handle themselves. But they felt something 
breeze by them, a rush coming over them, a shiver running down their 
back as they stood up from behind the car, revealing themselves from 
their hiding place. “Woah, watch where you shooting that thing. No need 
to lower the population of the living more than what has already been 
done.” Casey would say with a smile, ear to ear kind of thing. There was
 something just about them, a calming charismatic that was hard to not 
like in some way. They glanced over towards him, as he grew closer 
towards them.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="timestamp">

 "You're childish. I'm not putting up with it. Either you listen to me, 
and shut up? Or you can die alone. Like a pathetic coward." He said, in a
 whispering way. He hating saying those things, but he wasn't going to

 Ellie kept her shotgun trained on the two men as she spoke, “I’m 
working against her, not for her.” Her tone of voice calmed a little 
although she still looked angry, and ready to kill both of them at a 
moment’s notice. The girl nodded at Ryuto, “How about you? Are you my

 Her gaze shifted to Ezra and she suddenly felt unnerved. If the two 
survivors attacked her, would she be able to fight them off? Surely she 
would get some wounds and that scared her. She already had a cut on the

 pumping through her veins, she had forgotten all about it. She resisted

 He turned back around, and started walking again. Though, he wasn't as 
paranoid as he was just a few moments ago. He felt in charge of 
something, for once. As he was walking down the side walk, he noticed a 
small stuffed animal covered in dried blood and mud. It seemed damp, as 
well. He sighed, and kneeled down to pick the stuff animal up. He closed
 his eyes, and said something under his breath before completely picking
 the bear up. He kept looking at it, before he dropped it on the ground 
again, and heard some shuffling and movement behind one of the bushes. 
He started to walk over at to the bush, and saw what used to be a 
younger child. Blood covered, dirty gown, gone. Dead. He felt tears fill
 his eyes as he stabbed the creature in the side of the neck, and 
watched it fall down to the ground. Noah turned around, shaking his 
head, and wiped the tears from his eyes.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/6e7ab16d6255f197db66ee566f7198cbf208a6b3r1-1242-1248v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 Ellie’s teeth gritted in rage. How fucking dare this man act so cocky? 
So fucking defiant whilst Ellie pointed a gun at him? She would love to 
shoot him, right there and then, and maybe even watch him bleed out, but
 she needed that information on Abby.</p><p class="center"> “You wanna 
fucking say that again?!” She spat, taking a step toward Ryuto. Maybe 
she shouldn’t have as she could easily be disarmed right now, but Ellie 
wasn’t thinking straight. She was exhausted and angry. She just wanted 
to fall to the ground right now and tend to the gash in her side, but 
the infuriating urge for revenge on her father’s murderer – Abby – made 
her want to push onwards. Either way, she couldn’t do either right now 
and so she just glared at Ryuto as she waited for his response.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/b6766a90fe83c919d765e25e25bbc99cad8ff33dr1-1080-1080v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 the male sighed deeply as he sat against the empty shelf of the small 
store he had been hidding in for a couplde of minutes, his good hand 
located to be pressed over his peft shoulder, delicate long fingers 
feeling around the spot to find it surely dislocated, he sucked in a 
breath as he leaned off of the shelf, leaning to the side before his 
good hand pressed back, hearing a loud pop through his ears. the pain 
erupted abruptly, surging through his veins as he groaned in 
dissatisfaction. he needed to educate on how to fix dislocated shoulders
 painlessly, well not completely but he'd rather it be with less pain 
than this much. as the spot began to pulsate with pain, he groaned, 
reaching into his bag to see if he had that little bit of water he had 
saved, finding the semi-big bottle almost empty, about one big gulp 
left.</p><p class="center"> he decided to save it, he wasn't as thirsty,
 brows furrowing down in silenced anger as he arose from his seat, his 
bat barely attached to the side of the bag, glad it hadn't fallen off 
when he tumbled across the ground like a wheel would going down a hill. a
 light chuckle erupting from him, the sound rasped out, the lack of 
water evident on his lighter lips. black hair tied into a even more 
messied bun now, bits of it falling down the sides and the half mullet 
he had laid beneath the bun, looking like he had only tied his bangs 
back.</p><p class="center"> he moved the wounded shoulder around, 
feeling the restriction in the movement and the pain of moving it too 
far up or back. great, now he needed to use his other hand with the bat.
 Vanya grumbled in irritation as he exited the small shop, glancing 
around the empty streets, seems as if the runners simply walked off 
after not finding him. birds or animals must have alerted them away. 
that made him breathe out in relief, pulling the black mask over his 
mouth.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/b6766a90fe83c919d765e25e25bbc99cad8ff33dr1-1080-1080v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 it wasn't the gas mask he wore not only half a hour ago, it was a 
regular black mask that only revealed his eyes and hair, a mask that had
 been a regular daily thing way before. bright paleish green eyes 
scanning his surroundings before he ventured off to find a safer place 
to keep for the evening before Angel retured, his large hand raising to 
push the door open, wincing on his own acord at the loud squeak it 
emitted the moment he had pushed it open. confusion writted over his 
face as he glanced down the hall of the building to see only one of the 
doors open, his good arm reaching down into the pocket of his black 
pants to pull out a small knife, well more or less a knife.</p><p class="center">
 he had created it using some tape and scissors, well the scissors after
 he had broken them apart. peeking in lightly only to see a body tumbled
 on the floor, seeming almost lifeless until he noted the raising and 
falling of the body's shoulders. was it alive? he moved to step inside 
the room briskly, still holding the knife, his boots quiet on the floor 
as he took his time to creep closer, crouching down, his left hand 
moving to the body's face to open it's eyes, not seeing any type or 
reddening or glowing, now he wondered if this person had been bit in any
 way.</p><p class="center"> he moved to shake them awake, but it was a 
futile attempt before he reached into all pockets, storing away smaller 
weapons that could be pulled out without notice before he moved to snake
 his arms underneath them. pulling the person up to sit against his legs
 so it was much for easier from now on. his left arm slinging around 
their back whilst the right around their legs, pulling them up to carry 
with a huff, feeling the pressure over his shoulder. it wasn't safe 
here, the windows had been broken and he had no material to cover them.</p><p class="center">
 vanya grumbled underneath his breath before he started to trek back 
towards the shop with the person in his hands, and upon arival he leaned
 down carefully to place them down.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/b6766a90fe83c919d765e25e25bbc99cad8ff33dr1-1080-1080v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 Casey’s eyes moved towards their feet, taking one step in front of the 
other. Although the destruction and mayhem around them, they found 
themselves taking moments to enjoy too few things in life. The small 
cracks in the pavement were plants peaked out of them, it was odd but 
almost calming. How life can breakthrough, and become stronger. They 
would look over to see what seemed like another person, taking out the 
undead. Their eyes would widen with curiosity as they hide behind a 
parked car, merely watching. They had no intention of hurting them, 
although it was uncertain whether they would converse with the person, 
they seemed to be able to handle themselves. But they felt something 
breeze by them, a rush coming over them, a shiver running down their 
back as they stood up from behind the car, revealing themselves from 
their hiding place. “Woah, watch where you shooting that thing. No need 
to lower the population of the living more than what has already been 
done.” Casey would say with a smile, ear to ear kind of thing. There was
 something just about them, a calming charismatic that was hard to not 
like in some way. They glanced over towards him, as he grew closer 
towards them. “Casey, at your service, and you?”</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message info-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="linkblue">

 wasn’t very often that Cho would leave himself in a vulnerable 
position, but he simply couldn’t keep going the way he had been. This 
wasn’t the first time he had fainted in the middle of nowhere, he had 
done it a week prior. The fact that he was still alive, was a mystery. 
Part of him didn’t want to be, but he just didn’t have the gut to end it
 himself.</p><p class="center italic">Though he had only had been asleep
 for a short moment, a sudden presence was enough to knock him back into
 consciousness. He had felt slight movement earlier, but he didn’t have 
enough energy to fight back in any way. So as the male beside him made a
 rather loud movement, Cho’s eyes quickly shot open, alerted by whatever
 may be nearby. The new environment was something that quickly 
registered in Cho’s head, trembling due to the fear of the unknown, but 
also due to his lack of food and water.</p><p class="center italic">His 
golden brown eyes scanned the room, noticing the male beside him, 
flinching as he did so. The male seemed to be hurt somehow, but that was
 the least of Cho’s worries as of right now considering he had seemingly
 been kidnapped. It didn’t take him very long to realise that his hands 
were restricted by some sort of chain as he tried push him away, 
obviously not being able to do so. “Where am I?” He said, his voice 
muffled by tiredness. Was this one of the groups that he had seen? What 
did they want? Questions started to fly around in his mind, not too 
worried by them. If they wanted to kill him, they probably would have 
done it, unless they have even worse plans.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/6e7ab16d6255f197db66ee566f7198cbf208a6b3r1-1242-1248v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 Ellie frowned as Ezra described the two Abbys he had met. They were not
 the Abby Ellie was looking for. Abby was twenty, not ten, and she was 
blonde, not a brunette, and she had been told Abby had come this way two
 days ago, when she was torturing one of Abby’s friends.</p><p class="center">
 Ellie gritted her teeth and her lip curled in irritation. She slowly 
lowered her weapon and muttered a curse under her breath before sighing,
 “You two can go then. I don’t need you anymore.”</p><p class="center"> 
Ellie took a step back, showing she no longer was aggressive, to 
emphasise her words. She kept her shotgun in her hand but her hands were
 by her side. With a small grunt of pained distress, one hand went to 
her side and gripped at the skin. She looked at her hand, which was 
covered in fresh blood, with worry.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/49ad10c99571679d901a5499ca217f6779080aebr1-500-750_68.gif" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 The waking sound of the breeze flying past his ear woke him up, 
remembering the horrible events that's is upon himself. He was first 
just delivering people's pizzas now this fuckin world going to wrack. 
The male give off a sigh rubbing his eyes with his hands with gloves as 
he cut the tips of the fingers off to show his dirty nails. As 
everything was limited now we humans don't have cable TV mail men 
delivering us our mail, shopping markets. We lost everything as the this

eating Monsters beneath his own feet. He once then stood up grabbing his
 bags with a little amount of supplies, as he opened it showing his  
hand gun and a small ammo box and some snacks for the road. He then 
coughed rubbing his hands together, " Time to go.. " He said blowing in 
between his palms of his hands then standing up.</p><p class="center italic">
 He then climbed up on the edge of the building railing and started to 
jump across to building to building. That first it's like WHAT THE FUCK I
 AM GOING TO DIE! Then when you get the hang of it it's fine.. No need

seeing the dead walking around. He just continues to jump across

 Ellie narrowed her eyes at Ryuto. She raised her shotgun and pointed it
 at him, one hand on her wound again. “Do you want to be shot?” She 
threatened in an irritated tone, though some exhaustion could also be 
heard. She let her arm drop to her side once more as she let out another
 grunt of pain, “It’s just a scratch. I could still kick both of your 
asses.”</p><p class="center"> Ellie was half mad at herself that she had
 shown weakness, showing she could easily be taken advantage of, and she
 half wanted them to help her. Maybe, just maybe, if she told them what 
Abby had done, they would join her quest for revenge. Still, if they 
tried to attack her, she would kill both of them. And any Infected that 
came. She would kill every. Fucking. One. Of.

 Presley walked through the alleys of the store, a pharmacy. The last 
couple places had been a bust, bare shelves, nothing but dust. But this 
one seemed more promising, not much canned food but that was usually 
rotten anyway, there was no use in gaining an illness. Her hand would 
slowly reach over to the box of bandaids, before slipping into a little 
duffle bag over her shoulder. Even most of the medicine was bad at that 
point, but it was always good to have. But the best find was seeds, 
flowers, of course, but most vegetables and fruit. Better food, a more 
effective food source. Presley didn’t really like people, it wasn’t 
worth getting close, being close with people just got you hurt, in more 
ways than one.</p><p class="center italic">Presley was dressed in a pair
 of rather worn out jeans, an old band shirt. It was beaten in and full 
of holes at that point. She wore combat boots, with tightly tied shoe 
laces. Fingerless gloves covered her hands, as she fiddled with a bag of
 cough drops. A gun at her lip, and a bat sticking out of her bag, a 
worn out handle on it. Her blonde hair hanging over her face in a messy 
way, nearly covering her blue eye. Her face was cover with dirty</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/60ab8315b4e2684a6168ac99a59dca29d817ca9br1-1799-1292v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 “I don’t mean to burst the metaphorical bubble, but I think you might 
be the only scientist around. At least the first one I’ve met. It’s a 
pleasure to meet you.” Casey bowed their head towards them, a sudden 
expression appeared on their face, as they watched them. They seemed 
friendly enough, from what they had gathered from the small gestures. 
“So, how close are you to finding at cure? Do you ya need any help?” A 
chuckle would escape their lips, as they looked down to the bad they had
 on their hip. “You need something? I got water, medical supplies, food,
 even batteries somewhere here.” Casey always liked to be prepared, 
which meant a constant struggle for scavenging, after 26 years, the 
shelves seemed even barren.

 Ellie bit hard on her bottom lip as she listened to Ezra’s words. As 
much as the ruthless side of her brain told her to shoot both of them, 
loot their bodies and be on her way, the logical side of her brain told 
her to take the help. So she did. “Yes, please.” Ellie finally replied 
in a pleading tone. “Someone stabbed me. I don’t know how deep it is or 
anything.” She informed Ezra. She purposely skimmed over the fact she 
had little medical supplies in her bag.</p><p class="center"> Ellie 
cautiously slid her shotgun into her backpack then took a quick glance 
around. Just up ahead was a small store which looked not only safe, but 
unpicked which meant there would be supplies in there. “We should go in 
there.” Ellie told the two men as she pointed at the building, her other
 hand holding onto her painful wound.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/49ad10c99571679d901a5499ca217f6779080aebr1-500-750_68.gif" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

carefully around her cheek. would she need stitches? he grumbled lightly
 as he used up all the gauze as he put it over her wounds, covering them
 from the air outside and from any infections, now taking the barely

hardly any, onto her bruise over her forehead.</p><p class="italic center"> " Jesus Angel, what happened to you? "</p><p class="center">

 The silence was broken, broken with the sound of clanking armor. Who 
wears armor? Presley crouched down in the aisle of the store. She would 
peek over noticing the guy, who’s shadow seemed to cover her, it scared 
her a little bit. Presley’s heart started to beat faster and faster in 
that moment, although somehow remained silent. ‘This guy is gonna 
attract them here.’ The female thought to herself as she closed her eyes
 for a moment. The female would crouch about, crawling on the floor to 
gain some insight into what the male was doing. It was...interesting. It
 seemed like they were able to open the door, the door where they kept 
the extra stuff. Presley contemplated what to do next, could she beat 
him? She needed supplies, but she even doubted that she could. Her hand 
slipped into the bag, pulling out a knife. Before hearing a slam, 
glancing over to the shelves, seeing the man pinned up against them by a
 rotter. Almost immediately, they would hop up and rush over towards the
 top, jabbing her blade into the skull of the rotter.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/60ab8315b4e2684a6168ac99a59dca29d817ca9br1-1799-1292v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

Presley would look up towards them, narrowing her eyes as he spoke. She 
would take a step back away from him, unsure if he was trustworthy just 
yet, most people weren’t. The female’s skin was rather pale, her eyes 
seemed to send shivers of ice with her stare, although that was never 
intentional. Her frame was slightly muscular, with slight curves that 
were hidden by their clothes. ‘He sure does ask a lot of questions.’ The

 didn’t often help people her, so when did, it surprised her. Did he not
 deserve the same treatment? The female would walk beside him, making no
 sound what so ever. She would look at him once again, examining the 
armor on his body. He looked about her age, which meant he was a mere 
child when this all happened. Where did he get armor such is that? 
“No...thank you.” The female nodded her head, slide her hand into the 
duffle bag, pulling out a candy bar from the bag, showing it to him. She
 would keep it out for a couple moments before sliding it into the bag 
once more. “Do you have a place? Big enough ” Presley would take a deep 
breath before glancing down at the ground.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/49ad10c99571679d901a5499ca217f6779080aebr1-500-750_68.gif" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 rested his back, struggling to gain any energy since he had just been 
struggling for a couple of minutes. From where he was sat, he could 
barely hear the walkers outside, but he knew that they were there. It 
sounded like a lot too, which made Cho all the more ready to get out of 
here. After the response from the male, Cho was silent for a moment not 
knowing what to say about that matter. Clearly this guy was passionate 
about helping others, maybe he wasn’t one of those evil guys that he had
 seen on the road.</p><p class="center italic">”You say that as if it’s a

hesitating before taking a bite from the piece that the male held. It 
was edible for sure, but not the best meat he had eaten in the world.</p><p class="center italic">”No,
 you can check if you’d like.” He said, his clothes had several rips in

aside with a sigh of relief, atleast he ate and drank, looked very pale.

 blink felt a little too long, but that was probably because he had 
fainted moments prior. The rips in his clothes were something that Cho 
hadn’t really noticed as he had been walking for days. He didn’t really 
care what he looked like, because he thought he wouldn’t run into 
anyone. The male began to relax his muscles, easing out of the stiff 
posture.</p><p class="center italic">”I guess you’re right.” The mere 
thought of a walker biting him was frightening — he did not want to turn
 into one of those things. He seen that it did to people, he witnessed 
it first hand. He’s never seen anything like it, and plans to never see 
it again. This is why he likes to be a stray survivor, because he 
doesn’t want to get close to someone and then have to watch them die to 
the virus. The feeling is gut wrenching, and he wouldn’t be able to bare

right now.” He said, his eyes narrowing at the male.</p><p class="center italic">”What

crap. he must have left the makeshift knife on the ground in order to 
check if the guy was alive, and forgot about it in the process. another 
supply gone to waste, his brows furrowing in somewhat irritation at his 
rash choices, eyes moving to Angel who was resting, his jacket securing 
her greatly, it was rather big on her, like a blanket if he had to 
admit. god, to have a blanket at times like these, most he found were 
torn or burnt, or littered with blood and brains.</p><p class="center"> 
sometimes he even opted into going to living in the woods, find as much

 The towering buildings brought eerie atmosphere  if the undead

 incapable  of survival yet was a firecracker with a loaded gun in the 
end, his delicate  hand wiping across the alley walls as he peepered his
 head from the corner to get the jest of the planes. He lived in this 
neighborhood for  his whole life and yet it was distorted  in his 
memories, not one thing was familiar, not the streets nor the signs. His
 own home meant nothing to him afterall, it was riddled with satans 
creatures of the dead.</p><p class="center">Mika was apart of a 
religious family well born into one so, he didn't  take the whole Zombie
 outbreak as a man made concept. Though it probably  was, he believed  
it as a somewhat test of his paitences and will to survive. As his feet 
stumbled  out into the sidewalk he searched  through store fronts, steps
 as quiet as a mouse as to not alert any unwanted company.His hair was a
 utter mess, golden curls unruly and wild. His clothes were messy with 
dirt and soot what a poor day it was for  his white blouse and demin 
jeans. As he trailed to a market like store his arm was sore from 
holding his heavy bag. It was about  time to stop his pver gatherinh of 
junk and force himself to keep the necessities, laying his fathers 
shotgun to the floor. He had got by with killing very few zombies.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/6a448ed29b1ef6541ce920ba348924e736ae2d62r1-469-480_68.gif" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 Riley observed the waving figure, a human it seemed. "Hello, you got a 
name?" she called out to them, tucking her half eaten bar back in her 
pocket, gripping the pistol slightly tighter. Human interactions were 
always awkward, sometimes cringe inducing on her side, nah, she mucj 
preferred the company of robots, but certain animals were quite amiable 
as well. Humans were just too complicated for her tastes. "Are you 
armed?" she added as an afterthought, trying to get a gist of the 
situation as she walked towards them.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/ff48f51b72360655d02414238acd97fb2409ecccr1-220-214v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

won't attack me right? I have some supplies if you need any and a pretty
 cute doggo if you need some moral support as well." Whilst saying this,

just a few feet in front of the store’s front doors, was a long trail of
 fresh blood, shining from the angle the sun struck it through the 
broken and shattered front glass windows. Nearby the trail of blood was 
two separate bodies, decomposing and covered in buzzing flies. Their 
heads had been bashed in enough that they didn’t even look like heads 
anymore.</p><p class="center italic"> Throughout the utter silence of 
the mostly ransacked building was a soft groaning noise from the back 
left corner of the small market. A figure with half of their face 
missing, teeth fallen out and a knife shoved into its abdomen repeatedly
 walked into the door of the market’s bathrooms. Over and over, trying 
to get into what was inside. Fresh blood was smeared across the door 
handle, and mostly across the door as well. It wanted the prize on the 
inside, hungry and unsatisfied.</p><p class="center italic"> ~</p><p class="center italic">
 Listening to the flesh bag banging itself against the locked door in 
front of her, Samara’s body lightly shook. Not from fear, from the pain 
shooting through her body. She knew she shouldn’t have came here, it was
 a trap, it had to be. When she arrived, the place was mostly empty, 
besides two of the dead that showed themselves hoping for a meal. She 
ended their hopes quickly with harsh slams to the head with her weapons.
 But the third was unexpected. It was lodged in between two dangerously 
wobbling empty shelves, and when it fought itself free, the shelf fell. 
Landing on her leg and cutting a nasty gash in it.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/6a448ed29b1ef6541ce920ba348924e736ae2d62r1-469-480_68.gif" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 once was a man, his life was beautiful prior to some pretty traumatic 
events. Many knew him as a giving individual who everybody liked. He and
 his family lived in a run down shop, bandits and regular survivalists 
alike each came to their place as it served as a safe haven for all, so 
long as everybody followed the no violence rule, and got along, all was 
welcome...</p><p class="center">One day, as nobody showed up to the 
house as the doors were locked to everybody for several weeks. Many 
figured the family moved to a safer place as infected had grown thick in
 that place due to all of the activity...one day the doors were open 
again, not a single infected was near the place, and the area was eerily
 quiet. A small group of survivors headed into the house to rest for the
 evening only to be greeted by the man who owned the place, this time he
 bore a white mask which always seemed to be smiling. The masked man's 
dillusional insanity displayed for all of the world to see...oddly 
enough the rest of the family was gone... Leaving behind a dillusional 
maniac in their stead. It quickly became obvious that the man had 
developed an obsession for making and collecting masks. Hence the 
nicknames Mask Maker, and Mask were developed... Causing the man's 
original name to fade to the shifting sands of time...</p><p class="center">Many
 to this day question the man about what happened to him and his 
family..but Mask always seems to avoid it in some way. Or he outright 
kills the person who asks said question... He has been marked as a 
questionable ally ever since. So most people avoid him entirely, and if 
its gotten to the point where you actively go to him because you are in 
need something... You surely must be desperate...</p><p class="center">── ✧《✩》✧ ──</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/e69ec738298ffc5c9dad36ed62d6e54c89e3c3c6r1-735-459v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

where he was sleeping. He did appreciate that he carried him with a bad 
shoulder and all, it must have been difficult, but not too difficult due
 to Cho’s body weight.</p><p class="center italic">Cho was getting more 
uncomfortable by the minute, he didn’t enjoy having his hands tied 
behind his back. “Hey, so when are you going to get me out of these? 
Walkers are outside..” He said, looking into the males eyes. He didn’t 
want to not be able to protect himself if the walkers happened to find 
their way inside.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/52f51955a6b0a1c57624ff0983f06cda1a2f1ac0r1-828-827v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 —She made it back to the dirty and smelling bathrooms, the only place 
with a non-broken door. Locking herself in, she patched herself up the 
best she could. But, even so much as bending her leg made it gush out 
with more blood and hurt even worse. So now, she was huddled against the
 wall directly across the bathroom door, hoping she could get a way out 
of here and still be in one piece. Or not ripped apart by a hungry

 The streets were empty. Well, void of living life. The scraping of 
shoes still sounded as the dead roamed the streets. Despite all the 
years passed, they were still everywhere. It was eerie, quiet. Seeming 
like a horror film despite the shining sun and clear blue sky.</p><p class="center">
 An even sound of footsteps, the clinking of chains and the scraping of a
 bat echoed down the quiet street. The sounds belonging to a tall young 
adult with cold eyes. A hoodie hung low over their eyes and stretched 
down to mid thigh, an even larger shirt peeking out from underneath. 
Dark trousers creased around the top of black boots with steel caps.</p><p class="center">
 The young adult often went by Covielle over their real name Pan. That 
being how they introduced themselves to strangers. They were untrusting 
in nature, offering someone the knowledge of their real name being a 
sign that they were letting their guard down. So that didn't happen 
often. They hadn't had a companion or even a long conversation in over a
 month. Those that dared pair up with them always faced with the grim 
reminder of mortality.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message info-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="linkblue">

 was quite obvious sarcasm. "Heh, sorry if my humour is a lil dry, just 
sorta got used to talking to myself and with that came a terrible sense

kept quiet for a while, clutching tightly onto her homemade weapon. The 
bat was bloodstained and still had pieces of rotting flesh connected to 
the sharpest bits of the nails. Using it as an aid to help her up, she 
dragged her leg behind her. She used her old shoe laces to tie off her 
thigh, keeping the blood from continuing to pour out. Sam had also done a
 small bandage job on herself. Not having found any stitching kits or 
medical aid in months.</p><p class="center italic"> Making it to the 
door, she slowly reached over to the handle and unlocked it without a 
sound. Still not answering the male on the other side. Samara took a 
silent, deep breath, then quickly grabbed the door knob, yanking it open
 and raising the bat above her head, ready to strike. She winced at the 
way her leg reacted to the sudden movement and lurched over. Swinging at
 Mikaela, she missed his torso by a couple inches and caught her balance
 with the edge of the door beside her. She tried to get herself to 
fight, even though she was tired, wounded and dehydrated. It wouldn’t do
 her any good to be attacking someone who could be here to help her, so 
she slid down to the floor slowly. Staring down at the ground, she 
wondered if he would use that shotgun in his hands to end her, too.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/58f62e8dd91afeb694516e28b6dede6096b0557br1-750-750v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

her bag filled with medical supplies and food and a water bottle hanging

 As the door jogged open and the female stumbled out, examining he 
stepped back as he bat went to swing at him and missed terribly. It 
frustrated  him to see her attempt  to hurt him, pressing the barrel of 
his shot gun against her pretty little forhead as he squated down to 
grab the bat from her cold hands. The gun lacked a bullet in its round 
but that didn't  mean he wasn't  going to use it as a bluff to scare 
her. His safety  was more important than some little mistress scooting 
around a supermarket, tossing the bat across the room he hadn't  uttered
 a word  and only observed  in silence. A look of pity forming on his 
face for her. Was she bitten? did he have to kill her now? He wasn't  
aware what he should do, stepping around to place his foot on her wound 
and pressing into it. He was short and well dressed  even when flithy. 
As he pulled the gun up, he started counting as he pulled bullets from 
his pocket prepping to reload. "You have 10 seconds to tell me a brief  
description  and how you got this wound on your leg before i blow your 
brain straight from  its home land" acknowledging her wound and pushed 
his foot down further. He wasn't  playing games with her.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/f03e3728f669d2e8fdfb9c11ce5ae95f793ae3car1-199-253v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 it was nice to just sit there and watch the sky. The soft puffy clouds 
drifted across the sky. They would sit atop a rooftop, the beaming sun 
rays shined down on their shoulders and their face. Soon they stood up 
from their spot on the top, starting to climb down. There was only so 
long you can sit there, and just forget about everything. Over their 
shoulder was a bag; inside was water, food, a flashlight, a couple maps,
 and occasional stuff that they had picked up on their travels. Casey 
would brush themselves off from the shirt and the pants. They knew they 
should go off and find people, that just seemed to be the only thing 
that really kept them going. Casey would creep quietly across the the 
sidewalk; their feet gently tapping upon the cement, their fingers 
running through their curly locks of black hair. On the top of their 
head was a pair of goggles, sometimes they would wear them, to either 
prevent infection or hide their face.</p><p class="center">Casey paused a
 moment, feeling the warmth of the sun once again, uncertain where they 
should head from there. They carried various weapons with them; although
 they knew never use fatal swipes at humans, even if they tried it on 
them. They found themselves in a local grocery store, looking around. 
“This gotta be the place, something will be here.” They said as they 
heading in, looking around at the cans of food.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/52f51955a6b0a1c57624ff0983f06cda1a2f1ac0r1-828-827v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

she was now on the floor with a shotguns barrel pressed against her 
forehead, she failed at this all miserably. Which wasn’t even planned 
out. She always acted off of impulse, which was personably why things 
could get sloppy if she didn’t pay attention. Why she decided to attack 
someone who could help her out? She wasn’t sure if he could be trusted 
around her. Which was probably the opposite for them. She was a 
dangerous person, just not the wittiest when it came to living people.</p><p class="center italic">
 Looking up at Mika with a slightly colorless face, she stared him in 
the eyes for a moment. Wondering if he would even believe her story. 
But, her life was clearly on the line and fighting could never be an 
option with a gun pointed at her head. “A shelf fell onto my leg and cut
 it open.” She submitted and sat back, slightly unwrapping to show her 
wound the best she could. It was a clear gash from something sharp had 
cut down her thigh, and was nothing similar to a bite or scratch mark of
 a former human. “Theres even blood on the shelf if you need more 
proof.”</p><p class="center italic"> Her eyes widened with a loud cry of
 pain as his foot pressed down harder onto the wound. Wanting to grab 
his ankle and shove it away, she couldn’t be harsh with him now. Sam

how to keep Jade interested in the conversation without her having to

 eyebrows raised, shocked by the sudden change of heart. “Really?” He 
said, doubt filling his mind as the male helped him to his feet. When 
they began walking, Cho began struggling, attempting to escape his 
grasp. “What are you doing?” He questioned as they got closer to the 
back door. He tried his best, but nothing would give.</p><p class="center italic">After
 the door had been opened, Cho tried to push all of his body weight onto
 the male, but it wasn’t enough, ending up with him on the floor, having
 been pushed to the brick wall. “Are you kidding me!” He yelled, his 
voice weak and crackly. Attracted to any noise that would occur, the two
 walkers turned to Cho, making their way to him.</p><p class="center italic">”This
 isn’t fun! Are you crazy?” Cho used the wall to scale along from, 
creating distance between him and the two creatures. His back soon felt 
the fence that restricted him from going any further, his eyes widening 
at the discovery. Cho tilted his head slightly, realising his situation.
 With some hesitation, he approached the walker in front, throwing both 
hands at its skull, creating a slight puncture with the chains. When the
 other one came in front, he ducked under its arms, wrapping the chain 
around its neck, pulling as hard as he possibly could. As the walkers 
neck became looser, he kept going until the head was barely connected. 
In the midst of this attack, the other walker came from behind him, 
launching itself on top of him hungrily.</p><p class="center italic">The
 creatures teeth snapped several times, desperate for a bite of his 
skin. “Get out here!” He cried out, the walker getting closer and 
closer.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/ff48f51b72360655d02414238acd97fb2409ecccr1-220-214v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 Once  mika revealed he was hurting her he immediately  removed  his 
foot. He'd  never shoot a living person without  reason, it was immoral.
 Her story on the other band seemed authentic  skin he walked past a 
knocked shelf earlier, laying the gun  down to the floor he tilted his 
head ans crouched to the floor. He was only curious at the moment, her 
hurling cries of agony  mostly frightened him and his face expressed 
that as if he were a book. Sitting down on the flith floor he yanked  
her ankle  into his lap and opened his bag without  a word. He wasn't  
much of a talker when he was focused, pulling out a first aid from an 
old camper he found. His bag was filled to the brim with junk, old 
jewerly and even rocks. With a soft pop the  kit opened and he revealed a
 needle with blue plastic  thread while his other hand took a bottle  of
 peroxide  to clean her wound out. "Ah, this might hurt,i apologize." 
His serious tone became melodious like milk and honey to the ears, 
pouring the fluid into her cut and wiping it with a clean cloth before 
he'd begin triming the dead flesh. The gash wasn't  too bad but it had a
 few pieces of steel that came from the shelf that took him a few 
minutes  to pull out, sewing the thread along her leg til it was no 
longer exposed  to the sharply cold air. He had finished it off  with 
ointment  and a silk bandage  wrap before he scooted her leg away and 
wiggled to get up, pulling his things into his bag in fear  she would 
take it from him.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/52f51955a6b0a1c57624ff0983f06cda1a2f1ac0r1-828-827v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 She did notice the use of the word love but didn't mind, it felt nice

 Presley would listen to his plan. Starting to believe he didn’t have a 
how to any of his ideas, even if they were great. The female watch him 
with a puzzled look slowly forming onto their face, not sure what to 
expect from this idea. It seemed good nor bad. Presley would take a deep
 breath, closing their eyes for a moment or so. “Advertising good  
getting people. Not good if no resources. Resource then people.” Presley
 nodded their head. She had seen too many communities go down like that,
 once rations start to get cut, people start to get made, and uprise, 
chasing the fall or everything. It was a pattern. But not this time,

that scared, grieving, nervous mix of emotions in Mika’s eyes, she knew 
that he truly did struggle being out in the open when it was dark. She 
wanted to help him the best she could, so she would get him safely 
somewhere before it got too dark. Then they could sleep and move on in 
the morning. Unlike Mika, she was exactly the opposite. Her parents and 
her never came to a good understanding and they didn’t care what she 
ever did with her life, even if it killed her. But, it turns out that it
 had killed them instead. One by the hands of a nervous and unstable 
college student, the other ripped apart by the clawed hands of the 
undead. It bothered her enough to want to kill plenty of these monsters.
 But also motivated to protect someone as sweet as Mika. He didn’t 
deserve to die as a part of this apocalypse.</p><p class="center italic">
 Reaching down, she scooped up some dry leaves. Rubbing the null scent 
against her wounded legs fabric to try and rub off the blood, and maybe 
hide the scent a little better. She knew that it had stopped bleeding, 
but it was slowly drying and still was attracting a lot of zombies. She 
raised the bat above her shoulder and slammed another down to the 
ground, being heavily aggressive. Putting her shoe to it’s dented in 
face, she ripped the bag out of it. Soon being grabbed off by a jogging 
Mika, which she quickly followed after. She twisted her hand around 
until it was firmly holding his, not wanting to loose him if they got 
caught up in anything on their way down the road.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/52f51955a6b0a1c57624ff0983f06cda1a2f1ac0r1-828-827v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 It was frightening, the idea of being trapped in the ppen durinh the 
dark period. It always made Mika anxious, Sharp chills traveled down his
 spine as he lifted his head  staring across at the abandoned building. 
From the outside  it looked completely  untouched,gently  squeezing 
Sam's  hand as he walked a ahead before Sam took the courage to lead for
 him. He was grateful yet embarrassed  as well. A man scared of the 
dark? he wasn't a pussy... Mika bopped his head to get rid of all his 
pondering  thoughts,paranoid  he kept his head looking around  and his 
gun close to  his left him.</p><p class="center">Stepping up behind Sam 
as the two of  them entered the building, there was barely a scent of 
blood which  meant no zombies had gather in recently. He was scared to 
speak due to echos in old buildings so it was best if they kept their 
voices down. "we should go up the stair case, im pretty this is a hotel 
so we can find a lock able floor" with a soft voice he whispered inching
 his way to the stair case  with his panting as low as possible. The 
jogging  had him tired since prior  to their visit he had ran for 
30minutes from hoards. "We can check out  the carnival goodies

okay, I promise. Let’s just stay close, okay?” She nodded and squeezed 
his hand back, hoping it would reassure him. Taking a flashlight out of 
her bag, she adjusted it to a low light setting and glanced around the

 place in a while, so hopefully they could sleep well enough. Sam didn’t

 wondered his way down the cracked roads of this once great city, he 
watched as the leaves swayed slowly in the wind and vines twitched 
softly as he passed. He was out for supplies once more and he hadn’t 
stocked up on food lately so he was running relatively low. Though his 
eyes happen to fall upon a small group of walkers bandaging against the 
stores of a gas station... it didn’t take a genius to figure that 
someone was in there... and if there was someone in there, that meant he
 simply had someone new to scam.</p><p class="center"> with a cheering 
grin he knelt down, slinging his back pack over his shoulders he pulled 
out a small cluster of tins and cans that were tied together by a long 
piece of rope. Swinging them he aimed high before throwing them.</p><p class="center">
 The tins and cans bashed together as they hit the ground causing a loud
 echoing cackling sound, most of the walkers were attracted by it, 
leading to only 2 walkers simply outside of the gas station. Nothing he 
couldn’t handle by himself, pulling from his back pack he loaded a 
crossbow with simple wooden bolts. Nothing fancy but it certainly got 
the job done.</p><p class="center">With two bolts wizzing through the 
air and finding themselves suddenly piercing the skulls of the walkers, 
they dropped like a sack of potatoes. Packing away his crossbow he 
started to make his way to the gas station itself, hoping to find 
someone dumb enough to trust him.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message info-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="linkblue">

 their short lived laughter, Cho took a glimpse outside, noticing the 
rather large group of walkers that roamed outside. It was best that they
 started to get moving and gain some distance from the walkers. They 
clearly needed more supplies, so if they stayed here it would be quite 
dangerous in more ways than one.</p><p class="center italic">Cho nodded 
in agreement with the male, eyeing the building for a way out. They 
could sneak out back — it would be better than going out the front for 
sure. “That makes two of us.” He said to the male, noticing the sudden 
gesture. He had never wielded a bat before, never mind one that had wire
 wrapped around it. It did pack quite the punch, so Cho was more than 
ready to attach any walker in their way.</p><p class="center italic">Cho
 paused for a moment as he asked a question. For a moment, he hesitated 
as if he didn’t know his own name. “I’m Cho.” He said, shaking his head 
in disbelief. How had he almost forgotten his name? This world really 
began to take a toll on him and it was evident.</p><p class="center italic">Cho
 gently took the bat from the others grasp, swinging it around a little 
to get a feel of the weight. It wasn’t too heavy, but it wasn’t light 
either.

looked around before cautiously going in. It was a art store. He smiled 
and grabbed a shopping basket, this store was small so there wasnt

having a lot of fun to be honest. And then a Deaddy came. Yurie ran into
 it, his flight or fight kicked in and he claimbed the nearst shelf and 
stared down at it. He was perfectly fine, just stuck. "Shoo shoo Deaddy

 A whaling sense of anxiety hovered over his heart,Why did he ask such a
 dumb question? Of course that couple had been dead if not long gone. It
 made him feel immense  guilt  but he couldn't  pin the reason, as his 
hands drifted along the velvet  lining of the bed he pondered  up an 
answer. He wanted  a reason  to believe  they were in a better place 
that wasn't  riddled with stiff cold corpses or mindless love ones that 
groaned of both pain and undead hungry.</p><p class="center">"I believe 
they're  alive but they're not here. Somewhere where grass grows so 
thick its pillows to the feet and the sun dews golden rays to guide 
their dancing  across long streets. The wind that kisses  their face 
with every breeze and their future  child coming from the cottage they 
bore. I like to believe that they're  okay because  good  things come to
 those who wait" Uttering out, a voice that lacked sorrow and held 
confidence  with every word. He was absolutely  sure,positive they were 
okay just not in this world.</p><p class="center"> The light buzzing 
from the refrigerator being on gave a soft sigh as his hands lifted the 
bottle of water back to his lips only to pin the opening  to his  mouth 
and guzzle it while she had disappeared  into the bathroom for a short 
shower. He wandered about  the room, shuffling his hands through drawers
 to find used clothing that were cleanerly meant for a vacation. The 
soft  clicking of suitcases opening and the ruffle of drawers til he 
picked some clothes from the Male's assortment. They were lose but with 
some work they'd  fit, placing  the suit blouse to the bed and a pair of
  new jeans alot with  a old belt that seemed worn down, it was a clean 
outfit for once. Afterall, nothing was better than changing out of worn 
down clothing.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/bd0682bce31c0b94c43e11cffc93d7bbbd7a0b17r1-408-366v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 "I'm glad your not hurt!" He said. "Oh- thank you but no thank you

 to Angel, leaning down swift to wrap his injured arm around her back

blankets and pillows. "Okay! " he said. He walked into the store, this 
one had carts. He put the basket in the cart and pushed the around

cautious as he could. He found them and started putting all the blankets
 he liked the texured of in which was almlst all of them, and then

 Ellie cursed inwardly at herself. She was telling everyone her secrets,
 and what happened last time she did that? At fourteen years old, she 
was kidnapped and almost turned into meat for some cannibalistic cult. 
Of course, Ryuto and Ezra couldn’t do something like that to her, right?
 The man that tried to kill her looked about thirty eight, whilst the 
two men seemed to be in their twenties. In fact, they looked much older 
than her and Ryuto seemed to have a cunning look on his face.</p><p class="center">
 Ellie swallowed, trying to remove the anxious lump from her throat, as 
she reminded herself she had more firearms than the two and she could, 
and most likely would, over power them. Ellie then noticed her hands 
were shaking and she balled them into fists, attempting to hide it. How 
the fuck did she get here? Trying to calm herself, she made a mental

 A piece of auburn hair fell into Ellie’s face and she gently pushed it 
behind her ear. The movement, although it was her own, made her heart 
heavy. Her father used to always do this to her. She missed him, a lot. 
She had nobody now. Hell, she even left the one thing that let her 
connect with her father: his guitar. And his coat. And his small wooden 
owl sculpture he gifted Ellie on her fifteenth birthday. As well as a 
trip to an abandoned space museum (she had always wanted to be an 
astronaut) and an astronaut pin. The astronaut pin, which was usually 
kept on her backpack, was inside her bag. As well as her girlfriend’s 
bracelet.</p><p class="center"> Ellie felt like she had let them both 
down. She couldn’t even avenge her father without everyone around her 
dying and Ellie’s dark urges had gotten her pregnant girlfriend fucking 
killed. Yet, she couldn’t turn back. Not now. Ellie wasn’t even sure if 
this was to avenge her father anymore. She was beyond feeling pain, 
grief and numbness. Her quest to find Abby was now an obsession.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/b6766a90fe83c919d765e25e25bbc99cad8ff33dr1-1080-1080v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 the male suddenly felt tightness against his shirt, looking down at 
Angel with worry, was she awake? he stepped back a bit with her in his 
arms as the scream took place, his eyes wide before he looked out of the
 barely see-through window, his hand pulling her closer to his chest to 
silence the scream in the slightest. he looked down, his back against 
one of the empty shelves as he had slowly started to move towards the 
back and away from the windows, hoping the walkers outside took it as 
one of the runner's screams or grunts.</p><p class="italic center"> " Hey its okay, look at me c'mon "</p><p class="center">
 he had cooed quietly, lowering his voice to not attract anymore 
attention, still having her held in his arms, the pressure around his 
left shoulder surreal, starting to forget about the pain that took place
 altogether, after this escape he should really ease the picking up 
people off. vanya grumbled under his breath at the shoulderthe breeze 
from the slightly broken windows ticklinf his bare toned arms, the black
 shirt having short sleeves only. his arms adorned with scars from wired
 fences, probably arrows and whatnot, he had been through most of it in

 the male shook his head, it was definitely his fault that he wasn't 
there for her, yet he didn't object verbally, his paleish green eyes 
lowering to look at her with some sense of sadness at seeing her tears, a
 light blush creeping over his tan cheeks, yet it was barely noticeable.
 he had no free hands sadly so he leaned down, placing a kiss on her 
forehead, reassuring her, wanting to wipe away her tears yet he was 
unable to.</p><p class="italic center"> " What happened to you? "</p><p class="center">
 he asked gently, moving to set her down carefully, a grunt escaping his
 gritted teeth at the pain over his shoulder, it was probably bruised by
 now from overuse, he could feel it slowly start to be restricted to 
movement even more and more, but he willed himself to wrap his hands 
around her shoulders, hiding her away from any harm, well sort of. they 
really needed to get out of the store, it was starting to get crowded 
out there and their only escape was the back door that lead to an 
alleyway, perhaps they'd have ro climb the fence to stay clear of the 
crowded street of walkers and as such and head deeper into the city.</p><p class="italic center"> " Met a guy while you were out, had to carry him back or he'd be free lunch for the walkers "</p><p class="center">

 his brows rose in confusion and curiosity at her words, now he really 
was interested in what happened outside that madr her hesitate so much, a
 grumble leaving him as he had seen her take the bag off of his 
shoulders, it contained most of the spare clothes the had along with the
 cans of food and some snacks he was able to find on the first floor of 
that building before getting chased by the bunch of runners.</p><p class="italic center"> " You sure it's not? You came back pretty rough, was it a runner? Walker maybe? or a person? "</p><p class="center">
 his voice was more or less childish, wanting to lift up the mood a bit,
 it seemed stiff and off so he'd like to get back to jokes and 
surviving. it was something he was very much used to. deciding to unclip
 his machete from the side of the bag, he held it in his good arm whilst
 the other was limp against his side. his bat being held by cho who was 
looking stuff over at the front. vanya watched her eith the bag before 
he took it from her hands, not wanting to weaken her even more, he could
 take on the pain, he had rven promised himself he'll keep weight off of

sat and watched him for a moment, looking through her own bag as she sat
 on the floor. Pulling out a clean shirt she had found a few days ago, 
hopefully her size. She could tell he was thinking hard about something.
 Probably about the couple that had bought out this hotel before the 
apocalypse. It was a bit sad, that they never even got to come and enjoy
 their time together here. Maybe it was an anniversary, or a honeymoon. 
But now, they weren’t here and were never coming back.</p><p class="center italic">
 Listening to Mika talk about his hopes for the couple, She lightly 
nodded. “That sounds like a wonderful place to be.” Offering up a soft 
smile, she agreed with him. Standing up, she walked to the side of the 
room and set her bag down. “I hope good things come for us, too.”</p><p class="center italic">
 Now being in the bathroom, she stepped into the shower and turned on 
the water. Looking down and the dark brown water that traveled to the 
drain off of her body. It made sense to be that dirty, but it was pretty
 gross that it was that bad. She grabbed a boxed bar of soap from one of
 the cabinets before she started to bathe, and gladly used it on 
herself. Making sure that she kept it for Mika to use when it was his 
turn. When she was done; she stepped out of the shower and wrapped a 
clean towel around herself. Peeking out of a crack in the door to see if
 she could grab her shirt really quick, she tilted her head at Mika.

 peeked out to hear her finish her short shower, throwing his arms

 the male scavenge around for new things to find, it was kind of amusing
 to watch. While she waited for an answer, or for clothes to be brought 
to her, Sam ruffled her hair into a hand towel to try and dry it. Not 
like she would ever use it, but had the zombies be deaf, she would have 
snatched up a hair dryer.</p><p class="center italic"> Peeking back out,
 she raised a brow at a beautifully made dress in her arms. “Uhh-..” She
 stared down at it for a moment before walking out to the bedroom. Mika 
was gone now, so she couldn’t really ask him about it until he got done 
in the shower. “Alright.” She shrugged and set the dress down onto the 
bed for a moment, walking over to a stand with a couple different 
drawers. Looking through it until she found a comb, using it to get 
through her knotted hair.</p><p class="center italic"> After a bit of 
struggle, she finally got it all and dryer her hair off again. Then 
slipped on the dress carefully. It was just about her size, just a 
little tight on the torso, being the woman who bought it probably was 
less curved and thinner. “It’s kind of nice.” She muttered to herself as
 she looked at herself in the dress, pulling her hair back into a low 
bun. She didn’t completely understand why Mika gave her a dress, but 
from the looks of it, he was going to wear something fancier too.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/bd0682bce31c0b94c43e11cffc93d7bbbd7a0b17r1-408-366v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 A rushed shower after Mika ruffled the til it was foam in his hair, the
 cold water streaming down his back without  lacking effort in its 
travel. It felt so good while also feeling like utter shit due ti it was
 being cold. He had many fears especially  the dark but the flushing 
sound of a toilet had to be another, shifting his eyes down they darted 
at the unused toilet as he stood in the shower, it was as if he was 
daring the toilet to make a move in his presences  before he turned the 
water off and yanked a towel from the bathroom shelf, wiping himself 
down til he was fresh and dry.</p><p class="center"> Reappearing from

took back  with him to the bathroom.He didn't  want to  acknowledge  her
 beauty just yet until he had tried his best to wear the rather large in
 size tux and twirl out. His hair was still wet like a childs poorly 
done job of drying yet he didn't  care in the slightest, offering hee 
his hand. "Can i have this dance?" insisting, music wasn't  required to 
have a good time, he wanted to fix the gloom of all their conversations.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/58f62e8dd91afeb694516e28b6dede6096b0557br1-750-750v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

tears as Benjamin covered his mouth. Noah couldn't believe that Benjamin

 once was a man, his life was beautiful prior to some pretty traumatic 
events. Many knew him as a giving individual who everybody liked. He and
 his family lived in a run down shop, bandits and regular survivalists 
alike each came to their place as it served as a safe haven for all, so 
long as everybody followed the no violence rule, and got along, all was 
welcome...</p><p class="center">One day, as nobody showed up to the 
house as the doors were locked to everybody for several weeks. Many 
figured the family moved to a safer place as infected had grown thick in
 that place due to all of the activity...one day the doors were open 
again, not a single infected was near the place, and the area was eerily
 quiet. A small group of survivors headed into the house to rest for the
 evening only to be greeted by the man who owned the place, this time he
 bore a white mask which always seemed to be smiling. The masked man's 
dillusional insanity displayed for all of the world to see...oddly 
enough the rest of the family was gone... Leaving behind a dillusional 
maniac in their stead. It quickly became obvious that the man had 
developed an obsession for making and collecting masks. Hence the 
nicknames Mask Maker, and Mask were developed... Causing the man's 
original name to fade to the shifting sands of time...</p><p class="center">Many
 to this day question the man about what happened to him and his 
family..but Mask always seems to avoid it in some way. Or he outright 
kills the person who asks said question... He has been marked as a 
questionable ally ever since. So most people avoid him entirely, and if 
its gotten to the point where you actively go to him because you are in 
need something... You surely must be desperate...</p><p class="center">── ✧《✩》✧ ──</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/e69ec738298ffc5c9dad36ed62d6e54c89e3c3c6r1-735-459v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

for Mika to arrive back in the main room again, she did a small twirl by
 herself to watch the ends of the dress following behind her. She wasn’t
 much of a dress type of girl( but this one was pretty alright. After a 
little while of silently admiring the dress Mika had found, she walked 
over and grabbed a water bottle from the fridge. They had really hit the
 jackpot. Raising it up to her lips, she took a sip and made her way 
back to the other side of the room.</p><p class="center italic"> Hearing
 the door open, she quickly looked up. Watching him pick up the clothes,
 she turned back to her own things and waited for him to change. She 
fiddled with the same switchblade as before, thinking to herself for a 
long moment. Her train of thought quickly crashed when Mika came back 
out from the bathroom. Raising a brow at him, he looked good in that 
suit. She looked at him when his came out towards her, and she nodded. 
Placing her hand on his, she stepped forward and settled her other hand 
on his shoulder. This was a nice way for them to be relieved of the 
gloomy atmosphere, even if it just lasted a dance.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message info-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="linkblue">

 her hand seeped into his, a smile appeared as the shorter male places 
his other hand to hip and began stepping back and forth with his feet 
til he could get her in sync with him. A dance without  music, not a 
word utterers, the soft tapping of their fett against the smooth carpet 
 was enough for his enjoyment. It was as simple as it appeared yet 
nothing more and nothing less. You can't  enjoy a world if you're  
always  upset with it, it was time for adaption to take its course and 
it had to start with people forgetting this past lives and trending 
lightly in their new life.</p><p class="center">"You look jaw dropping 
in the dress sam" snickering out he lifted his head to make eye contact 
with her. "we should set up camp somewhere near a stream in the woods  
after we finish in the carnival in the morning. Not many hoards travel 
there due to meek population. We can even separate  to grab goods 
without  much of a worry. I saw a cabin house up on a hill that was 
isolated from the city." chiming in he expressed all his plans and now 
they involved her. It wasn't  love, it was a new friendship  in which 
were hard to find in an apocalypse with everyone going insane or 
cannibalistic.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/5e9ec5d5b9887c9c81e8f504adca565a826c24b4r1-316-335v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 the smile form on Mikaela’s face, she grinned back to him. Happy to see
 that even people lost in a dangerous world could still have a good 
time. And now, they had eachother. To look after, to rely on, Sam knew 
she would stick with him until something kept her from it. She looked 
down at their feet and watched for a moment before taking a step forward
 with his, syncing up after a little bit. It was something as small as 
this that could really make someone’s mindset change. She had always 
thought she would be alone through this forever, never really smiling or
 laughing, because what enjoyment did the world bring anymore? But now 
she found that enjoyment and was happy to cherish it for as long as she 
could.</p><p class="center italic"> Looking back up to Mika, she 
laughed. “Thank you, good sir. You also look rather dashing in that 
suit, Prince Charming.” She smirked back at him and kept the eye 
contact. “Sounds good to me. I know how to make some traps for animals, 
and some that the zombies will easily fall for. Even some alarms if they
 somehow make their way all the way up to the cabin.” She nodded and 
explained her own plans back to him. Making sure they would always have a
 form of protection, wherever they may travel. Raising a hand from his 
shoulder, she lightly ruffled his hair with a grin.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/ff48f51b72360655d02414238acd97fb2409ecccr1-220-214v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 continued to drag Noah farther away from the hoard, he knew they would 
eventually catch up, the fresh blood giving them more if a reason too. 
He dragged him back toward the side walk they had met on, glancing back 
toward the approaching hoard every few minutes. He  sighed, Noah was 
only a few inches taller than him but he was heavy, not mentioning the 
fact he wasn't helping himself move at all. He huffed, swaying a little 
when he stepped up onto the sidewalk. He looked back at the hoard, then 
at the bush he had met Noah. He let out a tired sigh, dragging him the 
rest of the ways to the bush before he put him down next to the bush. He
 kneeled down next to the bush, sticking his hand in it. He pulled out a
 small batch, falling backward. He opened the small black bag, pulling 
out a role of bandages. He put the bad down, sitting Noah up. He glance 
back at the hoard once more, them growing much closer than he thought. 
He huffed, shaking his head. "This'll hurt a bit." He cooed in a calming
 tone as he pulled the knife out of Noah's side. He pulled Noah's shirt 
up, quickly trying to wrap the bandages as neatly as he could. He shook 
his head, finishing rather quickly. He put what was left of the bandages
 in the bag, picking up the bag then helping Noah to his feet. "Noah, 
you gotta work with me here if you want to survive." He said, his tone 
now cold as he watched the hoard ever so slowly get closer. He started 
in the opposite direction, not sure exactly where they we're going to 
end up. "Noah, please work with me." He cooed again, trying to nudge 
Noah to not give up so soon.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/b6766a90fe83c919d765e25e25bbc99cad8ff33dr1-1080-1080v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 the end of her boot against the zombie's throat, heavy pants escaped 
her lips as she lay sprawled out against the floor; desperately reaching
 for her katana that seemed unrealistically out of reach. The warm, 
slimy saliva of the undead creature slipped from the edge of its mouth

street-lamps, stubbornly shining into the night. It was as if they 
simply loved to share that amber glow, regardless of if anyone admired 
it. Under their steady watch the crumbling brickwork arose a nostalgic 
feeling, notions of romance under rainy skies. The road itself once held
 a well-loved appearance, the traffic of decades having passed over it. 
This was a street where real life had been, the turning of skipping 
ropes and shrieks of children. Emani let her hand touch the bricks, 
perhaps its abandonment was a temporary thing, that the universe would

 to stand up, but, like the weak person he was, he couldn't stand.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/b6766a90fe83c919d765e25e25bbc99cad8ff33dr1-1080-1080v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 the loud thundering sound of squaking shoes resonated against the empty
 street, despite the cause of the sound trying to be as quiet as 
possible, he still made a lot of sound, regretting picking up these 
shoes in that thrift shop, they were low quality and emidiately started 
to squeak the moment he accidentally stepped into a puddle, a small one 
at that. now he was quite fast on his feet, the shoes despite being bad 
brought him somewhat speed as he tan, long legs taking him away to find 
any sort of safe place to hide away from those two runners that were 
close on his tail. he grumbled under his breath, leaning down in the 
slightest to gain more speed on them, his eyes wide with some worry, not
 wanting to get mauled like he almost did last time.</p><p class="center">
 being used as live bait was never fun to him, but he hated how the 
people from his last group had tempted him into doing a lot of stuff he 
did not want to, he was very competitive ever since he was a child, his 
parents keeping him alive as he had been raised during this hellhole of a
 world. they had been living at the countryside where it was all to the 
most peaceful and quiet, until that group came, tearing down their house
 with bombs that left the male with scars littering his left side of zhe
 torso, hidden by his clothes. sadly his mother and father hadn't made 
it, but he did and he was taken as a new 'member' of the group, more 
like a slave than what he was told.</p><p class="center"> he cursed 
under his breath lightly, holding his trusty bat in hand, not having 
enough time to cut that barbed wire he was working on to wrap it around 
the tip of it to make it far more deadlier, so he only used it as brute 
force. he turned around swiftly, swinging his bat up with a quick 
motion, sending the closest runner to pummel to the side, smashing the 
blood stained bat down on it's head to finish it off, it didnt need to 
get up.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/b6766a90fe83c919d765e25e25bbc99cad8ff33dr1-1080-1080v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 he grumbled under his breath, raising the bat once again only to the 
the runner run straight at him, making the male throw the bat at it, 
hitting it's chest barely, lucky to have it slowed down as he reached 
for his knife, raising it slightly before he threw it swiftly, the knife
 landing straight into the runner's forehead, causing it to fall to the 
side in vain of it's tries to get him. he huffed for some air, his lungs
 not used to running so much, he really needed to bring his stamina up a
 lot more that it was right now. theon moved to walk towards the runner,
 gloved hand wrapping around the handle of the knife, pulling it out 
briskly and wiping the blade off onto his sleeve, cleaning it away from 
the blood before he put it back into it's spot.</p><p class="center"> he
 turned to his bat, raising it up only to see it snap right before him 
and break, had he really thrown it that hard in the midst of his panic? a
 loud curse left him, throwing the piece in his hand away in anger, he 
could have kept it longer if he hadn't thrown it, but if he didn't throw
 it he'd be dead on the spot. atleast he was alive. theon grumbled, 
adjusting the strap of the medium duffel that was slung around his back,
 moving to jog further down the street, the neighbourhood he was in was 
rather deserted, he was sure the houses were cleared, what he only 
needed was a temporary place to rest.</p><p class="center"> and so he 
did, moved to jog up to one of the house with somewhat hesitation, 
reaching for the door handle gently before he pushed it down and 
attempted to push the door open, brow raising underneath the black mouth
 mask he wore, a mask that only revealed his eyes and hair, it was 
simply so he wouldn't inhale many toxins, the gas mask for spores safely
 stored in the duffel he carried. tiredness rippled at his muscles as he
 closed the door behind himself, looking around the entrance hall, 
wondering if anyome was still living here or not. worth the try.</p><p class="italic center"> " Hellooo! Any living person here?

just wanted to die, right here right now. All he was going to do was 
make Benjamin fall behind. But, then again, this was Benjamin and his 
fault. If Noah hadn't been yelling, Benjamin wouldn't have been stabbed.
 If he hadn't been stabbed, they no ty wouldn't be in this situation.

 It was getting late during their flocking. It seemed they were both 
satisfied  with their evening and Sam's  leg was more fluid so, it made 
Mika happy. He wasn't  one to keep emotions of sorrow nor angry. With a

 girls jeans " we can make some adjustments  because i have a old sewing
 kit in my bag and some buttons." For someone who hogged things he was 
resourceful  and well knowledgeable on what he kept. His attention  was 
quickly stirred away to begin cleaning up and moving his gun to his bed 
out of caution. All that was left to do was to dry his hair so he 
wouldn't  get cold and then rest for the evening.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="timestamp">

 Sven would amble through the forest's quiet atmosphere , stepping 
careful and slowly. He had a black messenger bag , a bucket of water and
 a shovel. He could hear distance growls and screeching from zombies 
nearby. This made him faster. A small cabin made of wooden logs came 
into view. Pushing though the door with his shoulder , the tall male  
would put his belongings in their respective places , with a swift flow.
 Taking of his massager bag , he'd pull out a shotgun he had found a 
couple days ago. Searching once more , he found 5 shotgun shells.</p><p class="italic center"> “ i need to find more of theses. ”</p><p class="italic center">
 Loading the gun , he cautiously stepped out of his shelter , closing 
the door behind him. With a shotgun and shovel in hand , he moved to 
where the the sounds were coming from. From a distance , he spotted them
 creeping closer. There were mostly walkers. Holding up the gun to it's 
proper position , stepping a bit from a tree's bark , as he aimed.</p><p class="italic center">
 The aftermath ringing of each shot filled his ears along with 
screeching of the infected. Blood decorated the trees and the grass 
below it. Hearing the click of the shotgun , signaled he was out of 
shots. Gripping his shovel , he moved circling the last walker until he 
eventually got closer. He threw his shovel like a dart , it piercing the
 infected's head from the sheer force. Everything was finally silent.</p><p class="center">╰──────────────╯</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/5e9ec5d5b9887c9c81e8f504adca565a826c24b4r1-316-335v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 Quinn made her way to the market. She wore a baggy white tee-shirt 
tucked in a black skirt, a brownish-green jacket, and black combat 
boots. She carried a messenger bag with extra clothes, money, little 
food, and water. She was going to the market to get weapons, it was to 
dangerous to walk around without any weapon. The only sort of weapon 
Quinn had was scissors that she hid in the inside pocket of her jacket. 
She didn’t know if she needed money, she figured no one would be running
 a shop for at least a couple months.</p><p class="center"> When Quinn 
got to the market, she was right; No one was dumb enough to run a store 
in the middle of the apocalypse. However, there was barley any weapons 
left. The few left were scattered on the ground, whoever was last here 
must’ve been in a hurry to leave she thought to herself. There was only a
 pack if five throwing knives, a small axe that was badly chipped, and a
 dagger. Quinn was desperate for weapons, she didn’t care how poor of a 
condition they were in. She attached the throwing knives to her waist 
and put the dagger with them. She picked up the axe in her right hand 
and looked around for anything.</p><p class="center"> Quinn found 6 more
 water bottles that she shoved in her bag, which means she now had 10 
water bottles. She also found more snack foods that would keep her 
alive, for now at least. After digging through more of the stores, Quinn
 found a smashed apple. She put the smashed apple in a ziplock bag and 
put it in her messenger bag. Once she found a stable place to live she 
could grow an apple tree with this she figured.</p><p class="center"> 1/2</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/5cffdbd651cdc4424423ef60b36122cc1be39c81r1-768-901v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 while Quinn was scavenging through more food, she heard footsteps 
behind her. She dropped her bag and placed her axe in both hands. She 
quickly turned around and saw two zombies charging at her. She grabbed 
one of her throwing knives and threw it at the zombie to the right, 
landing in the zombie’s knee. While the zombie was trying to get up, 
Quinn charged at the other and sliced its head clean off with her axe. 
She was shocked, and honestly, amazed she was capable of that. She 
turned to the zombie crawling at her mindlessly and smirked. She raised 
the axe high above her and threw it down in the zombie’s head with all 
her strength, be heading it. She took back her throwing knife and picked
 up her bag. She figured it was best to get out of this place and went 
out to the streets. As she was walking, she couldn’t help but think if 
there was other ways to kill a zombie. Beheading works fine, but she 
wanted more.</p><p class="center"> 2/2</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/e69ec738298ffc5c9dad36ed62d6e54c89e3c3c6r1-735-459v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 most places the building had appeared to be rundown. Many parts of the 
wooden support beams were clear as day into view and there was a 
lingering musty stench of mold. But of course in this day and age none 
of that surved as a surprise...however upon closer inspection something 
seemed to be... Off..things seemingly shifted on their own...a few 
moments later it became obvious. Things really were shifting. And in a 
flash a sign written in now rotting blood had popped up from a hatch in 
the floor.. It read "Welcome! Please enjoy your stay here just do not 
bring violence in here, and dont take things that dont belong in here 
and you are welcome.</p><p class="center">The sign was oddly decorated 
with shoelaces, blood and even moss and vines that grew on the stone 
walls... This place was surely a nuthouse.... A few minutes later there 
is a feint sound of a bell ringing a few short times... Presumably to 
alert the host of this...unique establishment that he had guests. Soon 
the sign had dropped back into the floor as the weird contraption reset 
itself... Perhaps the guy running here was actually some sort of 
elaborate trap maker... Afterall there didnt seem to be many walkers 
near the establishment to begin with....</p><p class="center">Mask had 
been sitting in his little space as he had been working on... "Making" A
 mask of sorts. He hummed an inaudible tune that really had no distinct 
markers to what it was as his thoughts were cut off by the ringing of a 
bell he had next to him attached to a system of his. His hidden face 
contorted into a smile as he turned and stopped the bell from ringing.</p><p class="center italic">"Oh boy new guests! I have been lonely so very long. I just hope they are good people!"</p><p class="center">The masked lunatic had exclaimed only to himself as he quickly shifted and moved through the house in unexplained fashions.</p><p class="center">── ✧《✩》✧ ──</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/fd1a1d17e9c68c4c98a31cb6274a284bf3c3ad43r1-828-957v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 🍙 Noah kept trying to walk on his own two feet without the help of 
Benjamin. He felt useless, and from his lower waist down, he couldn't 
feel a thing. It was numb. Like he lost all sense in his body. Noah 
didn't want Benjamin to get himself hurt trying to help him, so, he 
tried to push a few words out. "Benjamin," He tried, stuttering. "..I'm 
not going-" He inhaled, sharply, mid-sentence. "going to be able to go 
with you." He said, in a shaky tone. "If anything, your back.." He 
suggested, his legs limp.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/0ef08b538dbf81db935fe274d1a3896bf63e3042r1-736-713v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 his eyes darted across the entrance hall as he closed the door behind 
himself, his foot raising just to step forward when his ears picked up 
on a lighter click in the floor, the sign appearing as if out of 
nowhere, rather unique eyes darting across the words then the 
decorations of the sign. had he fucked up? his head lifted to look 
around, alerted by the bells that suddenly resonated against the walls 
of the run down house, the male moving on to step forward, dark brown 
hair tied into a bun from before he had arrived here, so he could see 
far more clearer, yet some pieces of his bangs and hair fell out over 
his forehead and side, glad he didn't have such long hair as one of his 
once teammates had.</p><p class="italic center"> " I might have really fucked up "</p><p class="center">
 the mall whispered to himself, looking around the place as he had 
walked further in and away from the spot where the sign that disappeared
 into. he might have been walking into a trap, but it might even be 
better than being mauled by walkers and what not outside. atleast he'd 
die by a person and not one of those things. brows raising in curiosity 
and worry as he moved to reach back into his pocket, taking out his 
knife just in case, the bells could have alerted somethinf and the host 
of the building might even be dead, who knew how long this was here.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/f4573025910ad9b95dcf3f72b812b8ab1d7e37d2r1-720-682v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 Constance would cover her ears. The dreadful and horrific banging of 
the rotting zombies only grew louder. The girl would sit there for a 
good fifteen minutes, hoping they would lose interest but they never do 
so, only attracting more. She would finally get the courage to find a 
way to escape. They were going to get in eventually. The barricade that 
the small child had put there wasn’t very affective. She would force her
 weak and shaken self up, emotionally and physically tired. She couldn’t
 get the sight of her parents being ripped apart right in front of her. 
This event didn’t take place too long ago. It was a miracle she made it 
out alive. Constance would begin to walk around, looking for an exit. 
Suddenly, a loud sound of glass shattering took her attention. She would
 jump, spooked by the roaring sound. She would turn her head to see the 
glass door shattered. The pile up of the zombies caused too much force 
on it, causing the door to finally give out. The child would yelp, 
running to a window. It was very high up, too high for her height. She 
began to frantically look for a physical object to stand on. The zombies
 closest towards the door would begin to climb over the ice cream 
freezer that she placed there to keep them from getting in. Soon enough 
Constance would see a chair behind the counter. The workers must’ve sat 
there while on shift. Constance would rush over, grabbing the chair and 
pushing it close to the window, trying to climb out as the famished 
zombies reached for her.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message info-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="linkblue">

 Sven would amble through the forest's quiet atmosphere , stepping 
careful and slowly. He had a black messenger bag , a bucket of water and
 a shovel. He could hear distance growls and screeching from zombies 
nearby. This made him faster. A small cabin made of wooden logs came 
into view. Pushing though the door with his shoulder , the tall male  
would put his belongings in their respective places , with a swift flow.
 Taking of his massager bag , he'd pull out a shotgun he had found a 
couple days ago. Searching once more , he found 5 shotgun shells.</p><p class="italic center"> “ i need to find more of theses. ”</p><p class="italic center">
 Loading the gun , he cautiously stepped out of his shelter , closing 
the door behind him. With a shotgun and shovel in hand , he moved to 
where the the sounds were coming from. From a distance , he spotted them
 creeping closer. There were mostly walkers. Holding up the gun to it's 
proper position , stepping a bit from a tree's bark , as he aimed.</p><p class="italic center">
 The aftermath ringing of each shot filled his ears along with 
screeching of the infected. Blood decorated the trees and the grass 
below it. Hearing the click of the shotgun , signaled he was out of 
shots. Gripping his shovel , he moved circling the last walker until he 
eventually got closer. He threw his shovel like a dart , it piercing the
 infected's head from the sheer force. Everything was finally silent.</p><p class="center">╰──────────────╯</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/0ef08b538dbf81db935fe274d1a3896bf63e3042r1-736-713v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

down at her leg, even though it was covered by the dress, she could move

 Benjamin continued to walk a little ways before recasting to what Noah 
had said. "Noah.." He let out a disgruntled sigh, picking up, he paused,
 lifing Noah onto his back before he continued on. "Geez your light." He
 cooed in a joking tone, the walkers growing father away as he starting 
jogging away from them. He kept glancing back every few minutes to 
check, but continue on, Noah was awfully light, but you'd expect that 
from someone who probably haven't eat in a bit. He glanced back at Noah,
 offering a genuine smile. "Noah I'll get you out if here alright?" He 
said, his gaze shifting to the far back hoard behind him. His gaze 
turned to the front of him, he stared at the sky a moment, looking back 
infront of him. He jumped, stumbling back when the walker tried to grab 
him. "Another?!" He hissed loudly, watching a few more walkers stumble 
toward them. "Great.." he hissed, glancing toward the forest that 
bordered the neighborhood, he turned to the forset, running as fast as 
he could into it. He skidded to a halt, the hoard and the few walkers 
still coming toward them but at a slower pace, he hesitated, looking up 
at the trees. "It would be good if Noah could climb on his own.." He 
thought outloud, he placed Noah down against a tree. "I'll be right 
back." He cooed, jumping up to grab onto the tree trunk, he slipped a 
little, getting onto the first branch with relative ease. He looked at 
the hoard then at Noah, the branch was high enough that walked couldn't 
reach them, but then again, once they do reach the forest they'll be 
trapped. He shook his head, getting back down. He ran over to Noah, 
picking him up once again, he glanced back, running into the fores a 
little when he stumbled upon an abandoned camp. He scrunched his nose, 
looking back at the hoard. "We'll rest here for a bit.." he cooed to 
Noah, placing him down.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/14911473422bd0004d6c67328407b7f774fa9078r1-1536-2048v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 Lost in the forest. Rather predictable, at least for someone like 
Casey. They just tended to wonder about, not thinking all too much about
 destination, which was often how they got watched. They pulled out the 
map that was pulled out of their bag fluently, their big brown eyes 
scanning over it. “Hm, I must be somewhere around here.” They pointed 
around at the location they could only assume was where their current 
station was. “Well I must be lost…” Casey would continue to stride 
through the forest, in their hand was what they seemed to use to protect
 themselves most of the time, a staff. It was long and had a rather 
beaten handle. But it worked like a charm. Casey would glance over, 
seeing a cabin in the distance. It seemed unlucky that it didn’t have a 
resident in it, whether it was ‘borrowed’ from someone else was able to 
be answered at that time. Slowly they would draw closer; hiding due to 
the sudden gun shots as the walkers fell down dead. Casey would gulp as 
they pressed themselves against the tree. “Hello?” They would yell, just
 loud enough for them to hear. “I mean you no harm, I am just walking 
through. Trying to find the city.”</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/49ad10c99571679d901a5499ca217f6779080aebr1-500-750_68.gif" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 while Quinn was scavenging through more food, she heard footsteps 
behind her. She dropped her bag and placed her axe in both hands. She 
quickly turned around and saw two zombies charging at her. She grabbed 
one of her throwing knives and threw it at the zombie to the right, 
landing in the zombie’s knee. While the zombie was trying to get up, 
Quinn charged at the other and sliced its head clean off with her axe. 
She was shocked, and honestly, amazed she was capable of that. She 
turned to the zombie crawling at her mindlessly and smirked. She raised 
the axe high above her and threw it down in the zombie’s head with all 
her strength, be heading it. She took back her throwing knife and picked
 up her bag. She figured it was best to get out of this place and went 
out to the streets. As she was walking, she couldn’t help but think if 
there was other ways to kill a zombie. Beheading works fine, but she 
wanted more.</p><p>2/2</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/d00bcddf1c6115ba9c14aa9852201806733d8111r1-675-1200v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 There was a bench in the grass next to the side walk. He gasped."just a

“Alright, Thanks.” Sam nodded to him and sat down onto the edge of the 
bed, using the sewing kit to seat the rip across her ripped pant leg. 
“If you need me to carry anything else for you, I don’t mind.” She knew 
the things in his bag meant a lot to him and she would protect whatever 
it was for him. But she wasn’t sure what all he would entrust to her. 
Sitting quietly, she raised up the pants to see if there were any holes 
left. She patched whatever else she needed to, then grabbed her clothes 
and went to the bathroom.</p><p class="center italic"> Exiting the 
bathroom with her jeans, the clean shirt she had found in her bag and 
the black zip-up jacket on, she walked over to the bed. Finding a passed
 out Mika, she grabbed the provided blanket and settled it over him. 
Crawling onto the mattress with a yawn, she kept her bat beside the bed 
and her switchblade at the holder on her belt like usual. Watching the 
door and windows for another couple of minutes, she made sure to hear 
nothing shuffling around outside or in the hall for as far as she could 
hear. Once she was positive it was safe enough, she laid back and closed
 her eyes, falling asleep after forcing herself to think of others 
things to let her rest.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/5cffdbd651cdc4424423ef60b36122cc1be39c81r1-768-901v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 Quinn made her way to the market. She wore a baggy white tee-shirt 
tucked in a black skirt, a brownish-green jacket, and black combat 
boots. She carried a messenger bag with extra clothes, money, little 
food, and water. She was going to the market to get weapons, it was to 
dangerous to walk around without any weapon. The only sort of weapon 
Quinn had was scissors that she hid in the inside pocket of her jacket. 
She didn’t know if she needed money, she figured no one would be running
 a shop for at least a couple months.</p><p class="center"> When Quinn 
got to the market, she was right; No one was dumb enough to run a store 
in the middle of the apocalypse. However, there was barley any weapons 
left. The few left were scattered on the ground, whoever was last here 
must’ve been in a hurry to leave she thought to herself. There was only a
 pack if five throwing knives, a small axe that was badly chipped, and a
 dagger. Quinn was desperate for weapons, she didn’t care how poor of a 
condition they were in. She attached the throwing knives to her waist 
and put the dagger with them. She picked up the axe in her right hand 
and looked around for anything.</p><p class="center"> Quinn found 6 more
 water bottles that she shoved in her bag, which means she now had 10 
water bottles. She also found more snack foods that would keep her 
alive, for now at least. After digging through more of the stores, Quinn
 found a smashed apple. She put the smashed apple in a ziplock bag and 
put it in her messenger bag. Once she found a stable place to live she 
could grow an apple tree with this she figured.</p><p>1/2</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/5cffdbd651cdc4424423ef60b36122cc1be39c81r1-768-901v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 With the early morning rising, the two of them sleeping through the 
afternoon til 4pm, there still was a the echoing enjoyment of birds 
flocking at the hotel window that finally  managed to awaken Mika from 
his slumber. As he lifted his head from the cushion matress, it was 
surprise he didn't  suffocate, wiping the drool from his part lips with 
his white sleeve before he began crawling out of his bed. His hand 
instinctively crumbled into a fist and rubbed  his eyes  as he began 
adjusting to the morning. A loud yawn echoing from him as he shuffled 
around the room pulling canned ravioli  from  his bag and checking  the 
hotel microwave  if it'd  work, busting the can open with  jabs of his 
fork and pooring it into two glass cups which were the only thing he 
could find.</p><p class="center">Allowing the food to heat up,stepping 
back  to Sam's  sleeping log like body he chuckled. She was sweet enough
  to drop a blanket on him and he noticed that rather quickly, leaning  
in, his hand shook her awake  slowly. "its time we go, i made breakfast 
and grabbed all the water and juice from the fridge." murmuring he 
inched back and lifted his bag over his shoulder. He left so much behind
 such as a oddly huge pile of rocks on the floor, it was insane he had 
been carrying all that across the city even when running. No wonder  he 
was always put of breath, lifting the gun form his bed he waited at the 
door of the hotel  in which the microwave  dinged and allowed him to 
place the cups on a counter, jabbing spoons in.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message info-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="linkblue">

 The predicament that the world was in was something unimaginable. If 
you would’ve told Kennedy that this would’ve happened she probably 
would’ve thought you were crazy. Well she wasn’t born when this thing 
started, considering it was 26 years ago. Kennedy was a pretty chill 
girl but she didn’t take shit from anyone. She hasn’t found a group that
 didn’t go batshit crazy, well except for the orphanage. But that didn’t
 go well at all. Cannibals were like a pet peeve to her, yeah zombies 
ate people but why stoop down to their level. They might as well go out 
there and walk among the decayed themselves. On her way home she spots a
 mini hoard of walkers blocking the short cut. "Why today? Of all days?"
 knowing that she cant get through them with a crossbow, she went the 
long way. She was a lone wolf when it came to anything, she believed 
that she didn’t need a group because she didn’t like being slow. By 
herself her runs were quick and in and out. She trusted no one except 
for boyfriend, Kenneth, who died from...well you know. She continued her
 walk down neighborhoods as she made her way to the big carnival ride. 
She had a sharp pain in on her side, a bullet grazed her side a couple 
days ago. She got it semi-cleaned and burned it with what she had. 
Kennedy wore a tank top that probably contain a whole or two and some 
jeans. ‘I definitely need an outfit change.’ She thought as she 
continued walking.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message info-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="linkblue">

shift into that of slight annoyance in response to her lecture. The 
female shoved her hands into her pockets, taking a few steps forward as 
she scraped the bottoms of her boot off on the floor in attempt to rid 
them of the gunk the stuck to the bottom. His attitude and response to

 was shaken, she quickly opened her eyes and instinctively grabbed for 
the bat beside her. Spotting Mika, it took her a moment to realize that 
she was in a duo with him now. Sitting up, she rubbed her eye and 
nodded. “I’m taking whatever else I can find.” Sliding out of the bed, 
she slipped the bag around her shoulders and rolled up her jacket’s 
sleeves. Putting on her dirty black converse, she tied them up and 
grabbed a thin, yet very warm blanket from the hotel room’s closet. 
Folding it up, she shoved it into her bag and grabbed her trusty bat.</p><p class="center italic">
 When the microwave went off, she walked after Mika to the food. Eating 
up her share of the ravioli, she nodded in thanks to him for giving her 
the food. “So, we’re heading to the carnival today? Should we do some 
sort of scouting method to make sure no other people are there?” Unlike 
Mika, she was willing to kill the living too. She had, in the past, but 
only because these two guys jumped her on the highway and tried to steal
 her things. Unluckily for them, she left their bodies behind for the 
dead to feast on. She still had some bruises on her torso to prove it, 
but not like she would tell that story to anyone. Everyone has killed 
something at this point in the world’s state, it was normal life. But 
she had killed living people, and some people couldn’t seem to stomach 
it if she admitted to it. Most travelers she had met in her early days 
of learning had abandoned her because of it. And she wasn’t sure if Mika
 would do the same. Sam felt like she would go crazy if she were to be 
left alone for any longer.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/5cffdbd651cdc4424423ef60b36122cc1be39c81r1-768-901v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 Mika was abit taken aback by her sudden need to hold her bat at him. 
With a nervous sweat he fanned  his face quickly  and stepped away in a 
rather hurry while she prepped herself to go, picking at his food he 
finished rather quickly. He acted as if someone would take his food in 
any minute  probably  from his paranoid  behaviour. They were now 
preparing  to search the carnival for goodies. Allowing her to finish 
her share of food, Mika's  hand balanced itself on the silver handle of 
the hotel door ready to leave.</p><p class="center"> As she spoke to 
him, he was sympathetic  and chuckled. "Scouting for humans? I've  never
 had a bad encounter  with a human so, i couldn't  tell you anything  
useful. But im not scared with you here and thats all that matters to 
me. I trust you'd  make the survival  decision  if we ever have a 
problem  because i have faith in you. As a person who only been with you
 for a couple hours my morals tell me whatever, you've  done in the past
 means nothing and now its time to develop our future. Think of this as a
 new life potty girl" Giggling  off his serious tone of voice, popping 
the door open he made his way down the hallway leaving  with his gun, 
bag, and, a well dressed look. Although  he forgot to brush his hair, it
 grew unruly from drying. The eerie  moist dripping of the staircasr was
 now well known  to him as they traveled down from the 3rd floor. Not a 
zombie in sight which was oddly pleasant in its own form, trotting out 
from the lobby the street was isolated  and across was the carnival  
they both craved for the goodies. his bag chimming softly as he walked 
and his humming melodious  in his enjoyment of it all. They were making 
their way downtown and they were walking fast.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/5cffdbd651cdc4424423ef60b36122cc1be39c81r1-768-901v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 Quinn walked down the city until she eventually found an abandoned 
carnival. She had never been to one before, since people didn’t really 
have time for those kinds of things. “What if there’s a gang or 
something, should i risk it?” She asked herself. Eventually, she 
convinced herself to go to it, after all she had nothing else to do.</p><p class="center">When
 she got to the carnival, it was a ghost town. It looked like no one had
 lived or even been here in years, which made Quinn feel safer. After 
all, why would zombies come here if there wasn’t a slight sign humans 
where here. Keeping her axe in her hands, she made her way through the 
carnival, looking for something to do, or recourses to take.</p><p class="center">
 While Quinn was going through the carnival, she saw another girl a 
little away from her. Quinn quickly hid behind a tent and stalked the 
girl, she didn’t seem like a threat. Not wanting to scream and cause

 Lev rolled his eyes at the girl. “Like I said, I can handle myself.” He
 scoffed. “I’m fourteen, not eight.” Then, with a side glance at the 
girl, he walked over to the infected she had killed and started checking
 its pockets. It seemed like there would be nothing of use to him until 
he found a dagger tucked into its pocket. He snatched it up and swung it
 around a little, pretending he was attacking infected. It was a little 
heavy for him but it was sharp and he could use it. He placed it in the 
pocket on the strap – that kept his quiver on his back – going across 
his chest.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/b3422f5fb17c2d2de5566bb31b0056f9071f46ear1-486-817v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

felt a bit bad for almost raising her bat at him again. She wasn’t quite
 used to the whole “staying with another person” thing yet. She had 
quickly set it down and left it be until later. When they were eating, 
she wasn’t too surprised at how fast he ate his breakfast, which she 
quickly finished her own after him. She raised a brow at the fork, 
knowing she could find use for them, other than just being utensils. 
Grabbing all of the forks she could find, she tossed them into her bag

too much noise.</p><p class="center italic"> Following after Mika, she 
set the bat over her shoulder, nodding when he spoke. “Yeah, it’s what I
 do all the time in new places. I’ve had plenty of bad ones over the

nodded again. “Thanks for putting trust in me. I’ll do whatever’s 
necessary for our survival.” Leaving it at that, she left a small hint 
towards him, letting him think about what she could do if she needed to

 The small frail girl would back closer in the corner, scared and 
skeptical about the woman. Constance never really liked guns, especially
 big ones. She looked back at the gun then at the woman. The young lady 
placed her finger over her mouth. It was a habit she got used to doing 
when afraid, or scared. She would notice the woman approaching closer to
 her, with her gorgeous golden brown skin and fluffy curls.</p><p class="center italic">
 The child would accidentally put pressure on her ankle, shrieking in 
pain. She would have a look of misery as she stood there, staring at the
 woman. “...” she wouldn’t respond to her, she could hardly speak for

 small screwdriver, ready to protect herself. “B-Back away! I have a 
weapon..” She would say in her cutesy lovable voice. She knew she 
wouldn’t actually harm Bish but, she was just afraid and shaken.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/133edf472bef26ff2c15aaee9384ba7fbc2a39eer1-448-326_68.gif" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 The male turn looking at her with a smile, " Okay.. Let's just get to a

he laughed, " Then don't try to break you ankle.. It's pretty simple 
just don't look down.. " He smirked looking at her, "  I learned it the

spray painted to hell. He sighed, " Well we won't ever now the name of

 The restaurant he had stopped inside was practically empty but of 
course in this city you’re never alone, a lone crash came from the back 
of the kitchen. Great first time he hasn’t been alone in months and here
 we are it’s probably a fucking stalker again, he reached down and 
unholstered his M9; granted he only had one mag of 15 but he’s worked 
with less before. The slide of the pistol ran back with ease as he 
chambered a round, the weapon was now hot and ready to be used, that’s 
if it was something slow and steady.</p><p class="center italic"> Sam 
got his pistol set to the low ready using his arm as a rest, this could 
go so many ways but the most he can do now is be cautious until the 
door. Slowly he shambled his way through the dining room to the kitchen 
door before peeling through small round window. Nothing..? Not a soul to
 be seen? Then what the fuck was that noise? God damn it now he’s gonna 
have to go in there and that’s just gonna cause problems.</p><p class="center italic">
 Slowly he pushed open the door readying his pistol as he walked inside,
 1..2..3..4.. his anxiety was getting the better of him and the last 
thing he needed was the long lived survival game of his life to be 
ended. As he moved through the door he scanned the room, still fucking 
empty and no noise.. oh fuck.. his mind finally realized why there want 
any noise.</p><p>PART 1/2 was</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/2e529697b25208bf20e4a6e06bfd2ccff16f54ffr1-600-600v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 With a hard slam Sam hit the ground as a climber tackled him “Fucking 
Christ!” He yelled as pans and silverware clattered around the two. This
 was now a power struggle, all he needed was to get the pist under its 
chin. The climber clawed at him sending more rips into his shirt 
scratching his neck and chest “FUCK OFF” he screamed before sending two 
shots wildly lightly grazing the climber. The creature let out a high 
pitched shriek before slowly back in off him, Sam stumbled to his feet 
raising his pistol meeting the one eye of the creature</p><p class="center italic">
 “You tortured soul, I give you mercy” Sam was full of pop culture 
references, they just seemed fitting. He fired three rounds into the 
climbers skull before it fell to the ground; it let out a small sigh of 
breath before staying down for good. Blood was slowly running down sams 
chest and part of his face, what a fucking day.</p><p>PART 2/2</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/d00bcddf1c6115ba9c14aa9852201806733d8111r1-675-1200v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 he was about to reach the store when a sudden noise made the man look 
around confused. It sounds like it's far away..another person? Or 
perhaps a dumb Walker hitting a car hard enough mistaking the items on 
the back chairs as a person. Either way he felt the need to investigate,
 he needed to know and perhaps needed someone he could talk with, all 
these months by himself performing autopsies on walkers and runners was 
slowly but surely making him go insane. Æschylus shook his head slowly 
before starting to walk towards the direction of the noise, seeing 
sluggish walkers every now and then and a few runners going in the same 
direction. `hmm?` curiostly, he increased his pace although his 
footsteps remained quiet. Then, seeing the car who made the ruckus and a
 woman trying to get inside. A slight smile formed on his face. He found
 someone he could talk with, but how do you talk with people again? the 
memories of him holding conversations felt so distant..the blond just 
had to figure it out later, now he just needed to get the woman out of 
there before she gets herself killed. Getting there before the zombies 
he took her wrist and sprinted into an alley he knew to be the safest, 
although very narrow and long; it served as a hiding place. "Foolish" he
 told as he kept on dragging the woman after him, knowing some of them 
were going towards them despite the car noise. Demanding ad intimidating
 would be the first things people would see when meeting him, more so</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message info-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="linkblue">

 he assisted the other, although different from stabbing their head, he 
smashed it with his baseball bat, first knocking them down and the 
bashing their head with the tip of the baseball, repeating the process 
untill the alarm faded away. a small sigh of relief would escape the 
man's lips before killing off the last walker that was near them `the 
others look a bit away, they'll need some time to get here` he thought 
before hearing the female "whether or not you decide to trust me it's up
 to you, although i came with peaceful intentions." His voice sounded a 
bit stiff as he explained himself getting his mask off as it felt wet on
 the inside, throwing it down. "do you know how to drive?" He asked as 
he looked at the car; the condition of it was better than the other ones
 he's seen so far. "Actually.." a little worried he added "can you reach
 the pedals?" Æschylus knew himself to be manipulative at times, but  
that is only when he knew full well what his target was capable of; as 
for now, the small snowflake in front of him was still wrapped around in
 mysteries.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/791bd1e01c52e97716ee539f6187a0b020b5700br1-580-374v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

hearing someone else then my own voice.. " She said looking around. She 
got out of the car hearing that alarm slowly fade away, as she still 
held her knife just in case. She got up walking to her cart grabbing her
 bag as it had a little supplies in the cart,  she grab her hunter rifle
 aiming it around the area, " Are you going to be a threat? Or someone

 Sam let out a small sigh and sat down against the wall his body now 
bleeding, bruised and maybe broken? He could tell with the last one 
there might be a rib or two that gotten taken out in that slam. Worst 
part of this was is that he was out of medical supplies,  he was gonna 
have to make due with what he had, which wasn’t much at all. Slowly he 
took of his bag and sat it In front of him, he pulled out some super 
glue and a small pocket knife he’d found about a week ago.</p><p class="center italic">
 He popped off the top of the glue and took of the now ruined shirt he 
had on “Fuck me man.. This was my favorite shirt..” he sighed as he 
ripped it apart with the knife. He then took the glue and began putting 
it on the deeper wounds trying to seal them, it wasn’t conventional but 
it did work. He then took long strands of the shirt and tightly wrapped 
them around his body covering the now sealed wounds.</p><p class="center italic">
 Thank god it was a warm day or he’d Be having a bad time with being 
shirtless now, he slowly stood up collecting his things and walking out 
of the restaurant. Down the road was a small grocery store, maybe he 
could find another shirt or something to cover him up. He put his bag on
 his back and kept his pistol unholstered as he made his way over, the 
grocery store had probably been ran through for food and such but not 
clothing items hopefully.</p><p class="center italic"> after a little 
while he reached the front of the store letting out a deep sigh along 
with a wince of pain. The glue keeping the wounds together didn’t leave 
much for flexibility on his skin to allow things like that, but it was 
better than getting sick right away. Making his way inside he wasn’t 
ready for another fight so now he had to think methodically with what he
 was gonna do. “Every other isle.. and check for sounds every 3..” he 
muttered to himself before beginning his process</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/5c3c3687c7325138c0de8e690718194b526af0ddr1-563-574v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

Presley would stand up down the ground, brushing whatever dirt had 
gathered on her shirt and pants. “Last bit of hope? I sure hope one 
building doesn’t hold that.” Presley proceeded to shake their head 
letting out a soft sigh. “People hold that...but some don’t want normal.
 They want this. We need a way to keep those people out.” The apocalypse

around 4pm at this point, and to say the least the girl was starving.

she wasn’t the best. She would only do this when it came down to her 
being really hungry, she disliked the idea of stealing. But hey, what 
was she going to do? She was broke, and it wasn’t like money even meant 
anything anymore. Trying her best not to cut by a piece of glass she 
found her way in, the place was a mess. It was surprising to even see 
the place standing, looking around the Shelves were pushed over. The 
place looked like it already had been ran sacked. A sigh would escape 
the girls lips, looks like she may just have to go another day without 
eating. Charlotte would continue to look around, anything at this point.
 Bending over she would find a bag of sun flower seeds. It was a little 
dirty but it was better then nothing.</p><p class="center">She didn’t 
want to spend anymore time in the shop, scared someone would also be 
looking for food and may attack her. Charlotte would make her way out 
the broke window again, being careful not to cut herself on the glass. 
She then had gotten out, looking to small sunflower seed bag she held.

would immediately go towards one of the walkers. She would gain a smile

 swung the bat at its head, before it fell to the ground. Presley

 stepped closer, setting her gun down. The child slowly lowered her 
screwdriver, realizing the woman wasn’t planning on hurting her.</p><p class="center italic">She
 would let out a soft sigh, putting her hands in the pocket of her pink 
n’ white hoodie. Constance would stare at the ground, trying her best 
not to make eye contact. She was nervous around the woman. She didn’t 
have any other human contact beside her deceased mother, father and 
brothers. The small girl would look up, tilting her head confused as she
 kneeled down close to her. She would touch her diligent orange hair 
behind her small freckled ears, gazing back to the ground. “yes ma’am..”
 she would respond in her child like voice. She’s thirteen years old but
 seems younger than that. Not only for the reason of her size but also, 
her frantic personality. She’s like a baby mouse.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><!----><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/791bd1e01c52e97716ee539f6187a0b020b5700br1-580-374v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 The female was walking with the grocery cart she had pushing it and 
looking around, she did have many supplies that can last for a week as 
there wasn't much food in this store. She just pushed the cart. The 
female was pale as she had short blonde hair. She was wearing a dirty 
green Trapper hat with a long brown Coat that was tore up at the end and
 some jeans and a white tag top as well some dirty brown boots. She had a
 bottle of liquor in hand drinking it as she pushed the cart, " Blah 
blah blah... " Her  voice echo in down the isle. She took a sip of her 
Liquor and walked. She looked around the isle, " Nothing and nothing. " 
She had a hunter rifle and a hunter knife as her father were  hunters. 
She looked around the Isle and sigh. She hated it being quiet.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/52f51955a6b0a1c57624ff0983f06cda1a2f1ac0r1-828-827v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 would look around, the place seemed to rather quiet- maybe too quiet. 
She was deep in thought, where should she go? What should she do? That 
thought was broke as she heard the small click of a gun being loaded. 
Bring her head up she would freeze. Shit- what did she do now? Hearing 
as a female would call to her she would turn to what could only be the 
person who made the gun loading sound. She was coming over? The girl was
 rather puzzled to say the least. Her eyes darting from the gun in hand 
to the females face. Charlotte was ready to scream, run, anything- no 
way was she getting killed here. The girl seemed to be getting closer 
and closer, but Charlotte was froze in her spot. Too scared to move per 
say.</p><p class="center">But the some what calming words came from the 
female in front of her. “Your not going to hurt me-?” She would say 
rather hesitantly. If she wasn’t going to hurt her, then why did she 
have the gun pulled out. “If you’re not going too, then why do you have 
that pulled out?” She would say pointing to the Rifle in hand. “I swear 
all I have in some sun flower seeds. If you want them, take them-“ last 
thing she needed was to get in some kind of fight. If it was the food 
she wanted the so be it, Charlotte was never a fighter. She was willing 
to do pretty much anything to not get into one.</p><p class="center">It 
was weird talking to another person per say, it must had been at least a
 month sense she had actually spoken to something, it was nice but the 
female in front of her; she looked like she could beat Charlotte to a 
bloody pulp in seconds. Then again it wasn’t that hard, the girl most 
likely wouldn’t even be able to properly fight back.</p><p class="center">The
 girl would force on her words. Seems to be she has some kind of accent,
 not from this area. She had never seen her before, so maybe she was 
just a traveller making her way through.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/f4573025910ad9b95dcf3f72b812b8ab1d7e37d2r1-720-682v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

the hot air mix with a breeze, she frowned and huffed. Taking off her 
jacket, she tied it around her waist and continued to walk. “I fucking 
hate warm weather.” She looked up to see Mika staring at her, which she 
narrowed her eyes and stared back at him with a little grin. “What’s up,
 Charming? A little strong for you?” She laughed and walked past a 
decaying corpse, blinking at the squishing sound it made when she 
stepped on some of the remains of organs. “Gross.” She lifted up a leg 
and wiped the bottom of her shoe against the help center desk.</p><p class="center italic">
 Walking away from it, she rubbed her forehead and glanced back once 
more. Quickly stopping herself when she almost ran into Mika who was now
 in front of her. “Everyone is homeless, Mika. They’ll take whatever 
they can get regardless of what you look like. Either that, or they’ll 
use you for bait. I’ve seen all sorts of shit.” She slowly blinked at 
him when he said “pretty princess”. “Yeah, they’d be all over you~”</p><p class="center italic">
 Once outside, she wiped her feet in the grass. Good enough. “I told you
 to drop it-“ She stood and stared at him doing the stanky leg. “What. 
The. Fuck. Is that.” She stared for a moment longer before she burst out
 into laughter. It looked so stupidly funny she had to laugh. Standing 
up straight again, she watched Mika snatch a backpack off of a corpse. 
“We could probably get you a My Little Pony one from one of the stands, 
yaknow.” She grinned as she joked with him.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/f7cee5c7ed0311feea7cf0d44989db2ced4dc416r1-159-158v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 Sam had drifted off into a light sleep unt he heard some movement and 
crashing, he jumped awake grabbing the pistol he had by his side. He 
only had about 8 or so rounds left but he was gonna have to make them 
work, besides if he was shooting he wasn’t gonna miss. He stood up 
seeing his reflection in the window of the office, his hair was ragged 
and the blood on his face had dried; the ripped up shirt bandages he had
 were dripping blood down his torso. He was in bad shape and definitely 
not gonna win of this was the rate he was gonna keep going “You’ve seen 
better days Sammy..” he mumbled to himself in the mirror before slowly 
walking out of the office and back into the main store</p><p class="center italic">
 a soft hello came from one of the isles along with the clanging of a 
cart, a female definitely but he hadn’t figured out how well supplied 
she was. He then heard the clattering of cans behind him, someone else 
too? Fuck.. this wasn’t gonna go in his favor especially looking like 
how he is now, who the hell was gonna try and take care of him? Let 
alone not rob him for all he’s worth at the moment, he needed to think 
this through.</p><p class="center italic"> He slowly came around the 
corner to see a woman standing there with a shopping cart, and a man in a
 rugged coat. He quickly hid back before they saw him, this ain’t good 
at all now he was gonna have to play this out just right or else they’d 
over power him. Slowly he racked the slide taking a deep breath hoping 
neither of the two would hear the metallic clack of it charging.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/f03e3728f669d2e8fdfb9c11ce5ae95f793ae3car1-199-253v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 Charlotte would watch as the female would put the rifle away, it was 
completely understandable. Wanting to have protection and all, her eyes 
would look the girl up and down. She seemed to have a rather muscular 
shape to her. Charlotte on the other hand was quite the opposite to say 
the least. Standing at 5’5 the girl didn’t really have much to her. She 
wore a pair of black sweat pants along with a black crop top with a 
picture in it. Her long brown hair out line her face. Her eyes would see
 the pair of dog tags around her neck, maybe she was in the military? It
 wouldn’t be that big of a surprise seeing just hold built she was.</p><p class="center">Blinking
 a couple times Charlotte would look up as the girl would say something 
about the food. She would share with her? Well that was rather new, she 
was use to people always being for them selfs not caring for the weaker 
ones. In say Charlotte was one of the weaker ones, giving in so easily 
to other people’s words. She would ask to put her bag down, the girl 
would nodded her head not seeing a problem with that. The female in 
front of her seemed rather nice. Charlotte enjoyed that, not having 
something yelling at her for once. “It’s fine, do what you please. And 
don’t worry about it. I’m-m fine with what I got. That is your own food 
after all.”</p><p class="center"> Charlotte would look down to the small
 bag of sunflowers, she was grateful for anything at this point. With 
this apocalypse she learned not to take things for granted. She would 
bring her hand up with a small cough. Looking back up to the girl, “Oh, 
my name is Charlotte. It’s nice to meet you. You must be out of town, I 
can tell by a same accent that you have.”</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/fd1a1d17e9c68c4c98a31cb6274a284bf3c3ad43r1-828-957v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 Samuel slowly lowered his gun still wary about the two, he didn’t know 
what to expect. Her smile was heartwarming but he couldn’t tell if her 
words were full of malice, but his words that seemed faint like the ones
 you tell a toddler so they get their way without knowing they are being
 lied to. His eyes never left Emile, something about this “Warm hearted”
 man just rubbed Sam the wrong way; maybe it was the coat on a hot day..
 yeah probably that’s what it was.</p><p class="center italic"> 
“Again..my name is Samuel Denver..” he said before he felt the sharp 
pain in his leg wincing lightly, he couldn’t stay on it for much longer 
or else’s he was gonna pass out from the pain and blood that he lost. 
“I’ve killed 8 people..Pre apocalypse, I was military..” he let out a 
deep breath trying to keep himself from passing out “And I don’t know 
how many infected..”  he studied her closely, her white hair seemed so 
clean for someone who was in the apocalypse. He then glanced at Emile 
his black hair was slightly dirty but still also almost to clean for the
 apocalypse, Sam didn’t realize how bad he really was until that moment</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/6a448ed29b1ef6541ce920ba348924e736ae2d62r1-469-480_68.gif" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 "Sure, anything for you!" She focused back on him and  smiled benignly.
 She wanted to wait a bit longer before confessing her love for him 
formally, after all they still needed to survive the first night! 
Getting up from her seated positon, she procured two snack bars and a

 smiled once again, each of his smiles fake. He was about to say 
something when he saw that Samuel had a broken leg, and seeing him in 
pain. His eyes looked like a wolf looking at a deer with a broken leg, a
 sadistic smile. All of that for a second before disappearing. He then 
opened his mouth and answered</p><p>"As for me, I've killed ten people. 
Nine effect, one not. A man tried to stab me in the chest to steal my 
food, I had to retaliate."</p><p>Lies, he's killed at least a hundred

 apocalypse. He then walked over to daniel, reaching for s handshake.</p><p>"Well

 city was a silent, zombie ridden one. Vines growing over the broken and
 worn buildings that once stood tall, maybe once houses many families. 
Some might've been the offices to the greatest minds, others might have 
been home to a fruitful cake business or shop. That might have been the 
case twenty six years ago but no longer were humans able to enjoy the 
feast of a peaceful life.</p><p class="center italic">The winds were calm, just as she liked it.</p><p class="center">In
 this horde infested city and on one of the rooftops. There was sitting a
 young girl, no older than twenty. She was sitting just on the edge of 
the roof and no, she didn't have any thoughts of suicides but maybe it 
once was one. The girl was far too long into life for that. What she was
 doing was peering down into the broken streets, with a scope on her 
rifle. It was a simple one, an AR-15 patterned gun with parts in the 
plenty. Although this ome was special, modified to be even more modular 
than it already was. Modularity being the strong suit of the AR-15.</p><p class="center">This
 one had a reciever for 45 ACP, a somewhat common pistol ammo. The 
reason she did this, was for both the commonality of pistol ammo and 
then the rifled barrel and three point contact advantages of a standard 
rifle.</p><p class="center">In the streets that this girl peered upon, 
shambing around was one big, meaty, bloater. The kind of infected you 
wouldn't want to be having an arm wrestling contest with but she was on 
the roof. She took a closer look, watching as the bloater walked around.
 Eianna waited for her opportunity.</p><p class="center italic">And an 
opportunity came. The bloater stepped over a sewage manhole and she took
 her shots. The AR-15 rocked back and forth as she began shooting at the
 manhole witb supressed pops of a .45. It had several sparks with a 
confused bloater staring down.</p><p class="bolder center italic">Then suddenly the bloater caught a small fire.</p><p>-</p></div> <!----></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message from-me"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/1e56d3cef4a4e6a52303bffe4865a7163cab8169r1-1877-2048v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><!----> <div class="message-content"><div class="text-msg rich-content"><p>-</p><p class="center">Her
 aim shifted to the small fire on the bloater's leg. Every shot that hit
 had ignited with whatever she added inside the hollowpoint .45 and made
 the fire grow even more. It wasn't long until the big infected was 
ablaze, thrashing around as it slowly burned to a crisp.</p><p class="center italic">She
 smiled, enjoying the somewhat sucessful experiment. Although a waste of
 ammo it was. She managed to mag dump a twenty round magazine.</p><p class="center">Eianna
 picked herself up as well as her things. Which were only a small agile 
backpack and her rifle. She made way through the roof tops, finding 
another place to settle; supressors did make guns more quiet but they 
didn't make them silent. So it was good practice for any budding sniper 
to move positions.</p></div> <!----></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/ff48f51b72360655d02414238acd97fb2409ecccr1-220-214v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 sat at the very top of a ferris wheel, in one of the cabs over looking 
the whole carnival. He was having a conversation with a stuffed bunny 
who was across from him. He talked as if the stuffed animal was talking 
back, pausing while speaking as if he was letting the toy speak. Of 
course the bunny wasn't but in his mind the stuffed animal was fully 
animated and talking.</p><p>“Now listen, someone's bound to come by 
eventually, they'll have food, water and we'll politely ask and they'll 
give it to us. Politeness is key Lobifu”</p><p>He said to the stuffed 
animal with an energetic voice, not caring about the potential infected 
about. He'd been up here for a while, because he felt safe, no one would
 think to look here and it gave him the high ground. This was especially
 good for his rifle, he didn't have to account for bullet drop as much 
which made aiming a lot easier. Then suddenly he heard a voice? It was 
faint and in the distance but he was sure he heard it. Quickly he picked
 up his rifle off the floor off the cabs floor. A M24 sniper rifle, it 
had a large variable zoom scope on the Picatinny rail ob the top of the 
gun and a bipod affixed to the bottom. He stood up straight and deployed
 the rifles bipod, resting it on the rail of the cab. Kungan looked down
 the scope and surveyed the surroundings carefully, there he saw it two 
people not too far in the distance, one was dancing, well, barely. 
Carefully, he turned a nob on the side of the gun changing the level of 
zoom to get a better look at the pair. They didn't seem too threatening,
 but just in case he chambered around by swiftly pulling the bolt back, 
then up them fowards. You could tell he'd done that thousands of times. 
There were 338. Lapua rounds chambered in the weapon. This would 
undoubtedly cause a lot of damage even from this range.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/ff48f51b72360655d02414238acd97fb2409ecccr1-220-214v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 Charlotte would blink a couple times, she wasn’t dreaming right? The 
female was actually giving her two full cans? She was somewhat lost for 
words to say the least, the fact someone was willing to be this nice, 
and not even know her. Charlotte would give a smile to her, “I’m ok, 
thank you honestly. I’m not much of a scavenger per say. So this really 
does mean a lot. Is there anything I could possibly do for you?” 
Charlotte wasn’t sure what she could possible give Darcy, but there had 
to be something. Maybe shelter? Clothes? Charlotte did have a good 
amount of clothes.</p><p class="center">She would look down the girls 
shoes, they seemed to rather wore. Most likely from walking so long, 
Charlottes eyes would light up, “I know what I can give you in return! 
You see, I want to say around a month ago I actually found a rather 
large bag full of different clothes in shoes. One of them have to fit 
ya.” Charlottes home actually wasn’t that far away. She wasn’t one to go
 far away, leaving her home scared her to say the least.</p><p class="center">She
 would stand up being her hand up to point to a house down the street. 
It wasn’t huge but it wasn’t something, the fact she even had a standing
 house was amazing to say the least. And she was rather proud of that 
fact. Charlotte was one to trust people easily, especially when they 
showed a kind heart to her. It did at times back fire on her; but other 
times it went rather well. After all Darcy seemed to be from some kind 
of military telling by her dog tags, so she had to be trustworthy right?</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/76d23f99d7c36d4c579c457650b23d45616e3018r1-640-640v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

the hot air mix with a breeze, she frowned and huffed. Taking off her 
jacket, she tied it around her waist and continued to walk. “I fucking 
hate warm weather.” She looked up to see Mika staring at her, which she 
narrowed her eyes and stared back at him with a little grin. “What’s up,
 Charming? A little strong for you?” She laughed and walked past a 
decaying corpse, blinking at the squishing sound it made when she 
stepped on some of the remains of organs. “Gross.” She lifted up a leg 
and wiped the bottom of her shoe against the help center desk.</p><p class="center italic">
 Walking away from it, she rubbed her forehead and glanced back once 
more. Quickly stopping herself when she almost ran into Mika who was now
 in front of her. “Everyone is homeless, Mika. They’ll take whatever 
they can get regardless of what you look like. Either that, or they’ll 
use you for bait. I’ve seen all sorts of shit.” She slowly blinked at 
him when he said “pretty princess”. “Yeah, they’d be all over you~”</p><p class="center italic">
 Once outside, she wiped her feet in the grass. Good enough. “I told you
 to drop it-“ She stood and stared at him doing the stanky leg. “What. 
The. Fuck. Is that.” She stared for a moment longer before she burst out
 into laughter. It looked so stupidly funny she had to laugh. Standing 
up straight again, she watched Mika snatch a backpack off of a corpse. 
“We could probably get you a My Little Pony one from one of the stands, 
yaknow.” She grinned as she joked with him.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/ff48f51b72360655d02414238acd97fb2409ecccr1-220-214v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 He looked at her gesturing towards the cart after she put her supplies 
away, his face turned a rose red. What the fuck is going on with him, 
this was definitely out of turn for him but he decided to shake it off. 
“Rowan as much as I appreciate it, I’d rather not be pushed around like a

 eyes dart from the rucksack that the other male dropped to his face, 
looking for any sign- anything, that showed any pass remorse or 
acknowledgement. But like always, she couldn’t read him. She could never
 read her opponent’s emotions or the tone, all she was was a robot. A

 her weapon tightened, but eventually let the male go and dropped the

inside her, from not knowing how to read something like a human. 
Something she had felt when her brother never returned after a year. 
Ayuri didn’t know what to call it. But it felt like she wanted to throw 
everything onto the ground in rage. Her eyes trained onto the bag. She 
didn’t particularly need it, so she left it as it is, not moving from 
the one spot she stood.</p><p class="center">”Commander..” she said softly before looking up to face the two guys and her voice grew a bit louder. “Where’s the commander?”</p><p class="center">She
 must’ve looked silly. She knew they didn’t know who ‘commander’ was. 
Her brother was ex military and she had called him that ever since. 
Everything she learned was from him. But at that point, she felt like 
the world was crumbling around her. Ayuri felt like no one was there. 
But as usual, she couldn’t put that feeling into a word. She despised

 Sam was pushed into the cart and dragged outside, Rowan told them to 
leave but he knew that she was gonna need help. He struggled to sit up 
on the cart as Emile ran them out and into the street “Emile turn around
 we need to go help her!” He struggled to sit up before they came to a 
stop on a bridge. This wasn’t the school, not even close he knew what 
was about to happen but he didn’t know what he was gonna have to do to 
avoid it. Emile was now smiling at him, but it was different from the e 
others this was a sadistic true to form smile.</p><p class="center italic">
 “Emile you son of a bitch..” Sam said before slowly sainting up in the 
now still cart, he tried to get out but his leg was keeping him there 
“Why the fuck are we here?” His tone had dropped, his heart was racing, 
his anger was soaring. Reasons like this is why he doesn’t trust people 
and not he’s got every reason not to trust him, Samuel was ready for 
anything but he just needed Emile to make some kind of move</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/6a448ed29b1ef6541ce920ba348924e736ae2d62r1-469-480_68.gif" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 Charlotte would blink a couple times, she wasn’t dreaming right? The 
female was actually giving her two full cans? She was somewhat lost for 
words to say the least, the fact someone was willing to be this nice, 
and not even know her. Charlotte would give a smile to her, “I’m ok, 
thank you honestly. I’m not much of a scavenger per say. So this really 
does mean a lot. Is there anything I could possibly do for you?” 
Charlotte wasn’t sure what she could possible give Darcy, but there had 
to be something. Maybe shelter? Clothes? Charlotte did have a good 
amount of clothes.</p><p class="center">She would look down the girls 
shoes, they seemed to rather wore. Most likely from walking so long, 
Charlottes eyes would light up, “I know what I can give you in return! 
You see, I want to say around a month ago I actually found a rather 
large bag full of different clothes in shoes. One of them have to fit 
ya.” Charlottes home actually wasn’t that far away. She wasn’t one to go
 far away, leaving her home scared her to say the least.</p><p class="center">She
 would stand up being her hand up to point to a house down the street. 
It wasn’t huge but it wasn’t something, the fact she even had a standing
 house was amazing to say the least. And she was rather proud of that 
fact. Charlotte was one to trust people easily, especially when they 
showed a kind heart to her. It did at times back fire on her; but other 
times it went rather well. After all Darcy seemed to be from some kind 
of military telling by her dog tags, so she had to be trustworthy right?</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/f4573025910ad9b95dcf3f72b812b8ab1d7e37d2r1-720-682v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 His last moments, Sam laughed at this sentence; maybe it was the way he
 said it or it was the disbelief that he really thought he was gonna 
kill him. “Go to hell..” Sam said looking up at Emile, there wasn’t any 
getting up while Emile was here Sam was to slow for that right now. His 
best bet is to distract him or find a way to get away from him, maybe 
that was the necessary action that he needed to take to get away from 
this psycho. Sam chuckled a little before propping himself up just 
enough he could rock the cart to where he needed to be, hopefully the 
ledge is just far enough to tip the cart.</p><p class="center italic"> 
“You know Emile it was a good act but not good enough. I knew you were A
 skeeze from the moment I looked at you” Sam slowly reached down and got
 his hand on his holster “But you aren’t gonna get this kill today 
understand?” He said almost confidently before unholstering his pistol 
and firing a round off at Emile, it missed barely passing his ear. 
Hopefully this buys him enough time; Sam began rocking the cart sending 
it tipping over.</p><p class="center italic"> hitting the ground knocked

 Constance would scream and kick with her right foot. The walkers 
carelessly continued to try to bite at her, not giving two shits that 
their head was getting bashed in by her pink, My little pony shoes. She 
would scream with anger as guts and blood splattered on her shoes. 
Finally, gunshots and screams from an unknown group would occur in the 
distance, causing most of the group to lose interest in the girl. They 
would growl and wobble off, guts splattering out of one of them every 
mood they made. ‘How are they still able to move..?’ Constance would 
think to herself as the heavy smell filled up the building. Two walkers 
wouldn’t follow, still trying to bite at and grab the small child. She 
would kneel down, managing to smash one of them in their rotting skull. 
The other would grab her by her bag, pulling at her. She would force 
herself to yank the bag off, making a run out the door. Adrenaline 
flowed through her body, forgetting that she even had a dreadful pain in
 her ankle. Soon the pain would come back to her, caucusing her to 
collapse to the stone cold concrete. She would look up to see a man 
falling from a bridge in the distance. It made her laugh a little. She 
would sit there, full of laughter, wondering how he got there in the 
first place.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/791bd1e01c52e97716ee539f6187a0b020b5700br1-580-374v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 Sam hit the water with the force of a car considering the bridge was 
pretty high up, he felt the sting of the water smack his body causing it
 to sting and knock him gasping for air but only receiving dirty river 
water. Sam struggled to swim up out of the water knowing that his leg 
was gonna be the Boone for him here, he managed to get to shallow enough
 water for it to push him ashore but not without him losing his pistol 
In the fray. God it was a terrible plan but it worked out, guessing 
since he didn’t get grabbed that Emile and moved on, now it was the 
choice of just getting to the school</p><p class="center italic"> When 
Samuel finally crawled onto the shore he immediately began coughing up 
the water that had filled his lungs. It ran through his nose and mouth 
leaving him dizzy and gasping for air, his leg was giving him a long 
dull but sharp pain through his entire left side. He was weak but not 
helpless, he was surprised he even made it out of there alive let alone 
conscious. He heard what seemed like a little girl laughing, kinda 
creepy for the apocalypse he must have been hearing shit. He finally 
managed to get all of the water out of his system, slowly he looked up 
to see a little girl laughing on his direction; is he going crazy or is 
that an actual kid in the apocalypse?</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/1f32a277e22734f116c4480c60b9a014a5e14a85r1-854-1590v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 Charlotte would turn her head, hearing the words ‘catch’ seeing as 
Darcy would throw the coke can her way. Some how she was able to catch 
it. Nodding her head as a way of thanks. She would then point out they 
should start going. She had a point, it had been rather quiet but it 
never seemed to last for long. She would look to the soba can in hand as
 the two would start walking. It had been 10-15 minutes before then had 
made it to her house. Taking out a pair of key from her pocket; she 
would unlock the door, a small creek would be heard as she would do so. 
“It’s not much, but I make do. Also feel free to take off your bag, it 
seems rather heavy.” She would say walking in and closing the door 
behind her. The bag Darcy had seemed to hold everything she had, in all 
honestly Charlotte had no idea how she did it. If she even tried lifting
 that up she would most likely just fall over.</p><p class="center">The 
girl would take the food running over and placing them in the kitchen. 
This must had been the most food she had in a pretty long time. A drink,
 2 cans and a bag of sun flower seeds. A smile would be pasted on her 
face, then making her way to a large garage bag in her living room. 
Picking up the bag with some hesitation due to its weight she brought it
 over to Darcy. Placing it down she would look up. “I myself already 
went though and took what would fit me. The rest just seemed to be too 
big or small. So feel free to take what you would like,”</p><p class="center">She
 had actually gotten all this from an abandoned sporting goods store. So
 to say the least most was brand new, this was one of her most proudest 
finds she had gotten. It took her a good amount of time to carry it all 
home- but it was worth it.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/76d23f99d7c36d4c579c457650b23d45616e3018r1-640-640v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 "Sounds good to me." A brooding expression had appeared on her face and
 she had gone silent. She looked vaguely into the distance, that dark, 
philosophical countenance never cracking. She was pondering what would 
have happened if she had never met Jade, questioning whether that would 
have even been possible. But on a deeper level, she was also thinking of

 The girl’s face would be a bright red, she would have trouble breathing
 with how funny she thought the sight of seeing the man hit the hard 
cold water. The sound of him hitting it, made her laugh even more. She 
would guess that he was dead for the fact of how vigorous he hit it. 
That made her have a bit of remorse. She would wipe a small tear that 
fell. Oh not because she felt bad, just because of how much she 
ridiculed the whole situation. The small freckled child would stand up 
from the ground, feeling her ankle starting to swell. Suddenly, the man 
would come up from the water, gasping for air. She’d look confused on if
 he had turned, and how quickly he did so. She would wince, trying not 
to stand on her ankle as she viewed him swim closer to the shore. She 
had a look of disgust as he arrived, vomiting an impure liquid. She 
would quickly yank out her bloody screwdriver as it was the only source 
of weapon that she had on her. She would stand in a combat form as the

 A screwdriver? The little one has guts that’s for sure, but honestly 
she’s probably just alone and scared of what’s going on in this 
particular moment. He slowly stood up putting most of his weight on his 
good leg, he held up both hands and lightly hobbled a little closer to 
her, he didn’t wanna scare her but he also didn’t wanna let his guard 
down to her l. Maybe just maybe he could get her to trust him enough he 
could take her to the school, this was the goal, he wasn’t just gonna up
 and leave her here.</p><p class="center italic"> “I’m not gonna hurt 
you I promise, My name is Sammy..” He said giving her his family 
nickname, it seemed like the right call hopefully giving her his 
nickname would help her trust him more. He looked down to see her 
swollen ankle and how soft balance she was standing “Hey you’re hurt, I 
know a place you can get fixed up..” he slowly reached out his hand to 
her “You have no reason to trust me, but let me try and help you..” she 
could easily stab him with that dull asss screwdriver right now but he’s
 hoping she will take his hand so he can get her safe</p><p class="center italic">
 Samuel was never good with kids, all of his past girlfriends wanted 
kids so bad but he always said he wasn’t ready. He was only 20 and he 
wanted to live his life, but now that’s come to a close and kids are the
 closest future any of us have in this now desolate world.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/52f51955a6b0a1c57624ff0983f06cda1a2f1ac0r1-828-827v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

hell- what?” Samara blinked at Mika, reading his face for a long moment 
before she realized both of them were lost. Shaking her head at his 
ashamed look, she didn’t feel like correcting him right now. “I don’t 
think you even know if you have rabies.” She spoke in a more sarcastic 
and joking tone, walking out of the area quickly, not really wanting to 
keep smelling the scent of rotting flesh. Maybe she was going crazy, or 
Mika was just finding a weird side of her. Honestly, she didn’t even 
know why she was laughing so much.</p><p class="center italic"> “Excuse 
me- you aren’t my first friend, mister.” She huffed at him. “Throw some 
glitter around and you’ll make the perfect fairy.” Sam watched him go 
off towards the basketball booth and followed. Watching him like a 
chaperone as she also did her own thing. Finding a vending machine with a
 few things left, she tapped on the glass to make sure it wasn’t 
plastic. Then, she raised a knob of her bat and smashed it into the 
glass, surprised at how less of a shattering sound it made. It was light
 enough that zombies streets away wouldn’t be able to hear. Using her 
fists, she carefully knocked away any excess glass and raided out the 
rest of the machine. Tossing Mika the same type of chips he had eaten 
back at the store.</p><p class="center italic"> Zipping up her backpack,
 she glanced around for anyone or anything nearby. Still not completely 
trusting this place, she glanced at the rides that were still up. She 
narrowed her eyes at the ferris wheel for a moment, then turned back to 
Mika. Making sure she kept a good eye on him and his whereabouts.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/1f32a277e22734f116c4480c60b9a014a5e14a85r1-854-1590v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 She didn’t have anyone? Heading the details of her story put a pain 
into sams heart, he knew his family was gone but he wanted to be sure, 
he wanted to know for a fact that they were truly gone. The bang from 
the walker startled Connie as he felt her wrap around him just a little 
tighter before they got into the school “I’ve got you sweetheart don’t 
worry” he said lightly reaching up and taking hold of her hand. She was 
alone and scared, he almost felt responsible for her in a way; honestly 
he was he was the only thing she’d had for two days.</p><p class="center italic">
 “Rowan?” Sam yelled as he limped into the gym seeing her sit there by 
the fire “Hey killer..” he said giving a slight smile. He was still 
soaked form head to toe and was honestly in worse shape than when he had
 left her, the bandages that had covered the deep wounds on his torso 
were now gone with blood slightly dripping out of them, he couldn’t put 
really any weight on his leg at all, and his hair was a thin mess that 
hung in front of his face. “This is Connie.. can you help her out with 
her leg? It’s messed up somewhere I think it’s the ankle..” he spoke 
quietly sitting Connie down on a blanket next to the fire</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/60ab8315b4e2684a6168ac99a59dca29d817ca9br1-1799-1292v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 “Why should the person that tell people what to do get a nicer office? 
It seems unfair to the others. Do they do more?” Presley would ask with a
 curious expression on their face. Seeing as they were nineteen, they 
had never known anything other than this life. There was no school, 
movies, friends, hugs, nothing that she didn’t have to fight for. She 
wasn’t sure how she felt about it, no matter how she did, it didn’t 
change anything. “It will be nice to have a place were it will feel safe

 Hearing her laugh brought a warm feeling to his heart, she said she 
trusted him and he wasn’t gonna give her a reason not to. He stood up as
 she took his hand, he gently lifted her up and out her onto his back. 
She wasn’t heavy but his leg still disagreed with what he was doing, 
rowan was gonna fucking kill him when he got there but at this point he 
didn’t care. He just wanted to get this little girl the treatment she 
needed, he began walking in the direction that Rowan had said the school
 was in hoping he’d be able to find it by the red flags she’d told him 
about.</p><p class="center italic"> “So Connie is it just you?” He asked
 trying to figure out things about where maybe he family would be “My 
family is back in Texas, they moved there awhile ago before I joined the
 military. I’m gonna find them one day..” he said like an optimistic 
anime character. Connie had to of been just barely old enough to 
remember when all of this started. “You’re gonna love Rowan, she is a 
super sweet lady. She kinda acts like my mom and gripes at me when I 
don’t take care of myself.”</p><p class="center italic"> slowly the 
school came into sight the bright red flags flowing in the wind directly
 i front of the gate, he stepped inside with Connie still on his back 
making his was towards the gym, hopefully Rowan wasn’t gonna yell at him
 too much for being soaking wet and dragging water into her place</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/df1f843514c98514cc3e0d9d1a7b68a50e93ed3dr1-512-384v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 didn’t know what to say to the...compliment(?), so she watches his body

as Blaise stalks off to finish off a... dweeb? She didn’t know what that
 was but maybe she could ask when he got back.</p><p class="center">Now 
stranded in a cabin with the person she nearly killed, she watches him

without him asking, she would’ve assumed he was dead. Her response was 
automatic.</p><p class="center">”Yes, please lay him flat against the 
ground,” she kneels down and rummages into her backpack for a cloth or 
anything that might help. She finds a piece of fabric and soaks it with 
an extra water bottle she finds lying around, then presses it up against
 his wounded side. Even with all the gore and wincing he might do from 
the pain, her face stayed emotionless when she looks over at the other 
two, standing there and just watching.</p><p class="center">”If you guys
 had any bandages or alcohol it would be useful,” she says 
absentmindedly as she tries to clean the wound with her cloth as best as
 she could. The blood was nearly all dry, which was a sign that he was 
wounded long before Blaise found him.

 The silk blonde haired girl was wearing her long, black velvet which 
covered her body and weapons underneath. Like always, the girl had her 
hair up in a ponytail with some hair that was shorter than the rest 
hanging down on the sides. Her skin was a slightly toned and her nose 
and cheeks gave off a slightly pink-skincolored color from the cold. Her
 hood was up which shadowed her dark, hazel brown eyes. The only 
noticeble weapon she was carrying was her spear that was holstered on 
the back. The spear had a long, steel stick and had a sharp, metal blade
 on both ends and black-golden colored. She was like a walking shadow on
 her own.</p><p class="center"> Skylar was walking over the main road 
towards the city. She knew it was risky to take the main road, but she 
was hoping on finding something on her way since the highway were filled
 with cars and trucks. Worst case she could always jump into the woods 
as an escape.</p><p class="center"> Her hazel eyes were directed 
straight forward. She was on guard and underneath her cloak she would 
hold onto her knife. Skylar was a someone who would always be ready and 
prepared. She had experience and knew exactly how quick things could go 
even at the moments you might feel the most safe. Most people would've 
used a gun, but Skylar was better with the melee weapons,- she would 
only ever pull out a gun if she was left with no other choice. Neither 
was she any good with far combat weapons so she prefered staying with 
the close combat weapons.</p><p class="center"> It was suprisingly 
quiet, but she didn't expect that to last long. Everytime the silence 
would fall, it would always be interrupted by something bad, either a 
walker or someone wanting her dead.</p><p class="center"> Skylar didn't 
expect anything else than worst,- living by that made it easier for her 
during the apocalypse. Trust, love, expectations,- it all brings you 
down at some point.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/f03e3728f669d2e8fdfb9c11ce5ae95f793ae3car1-199-253v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 The female walked down the halls with red flags and some candles being 
lit looking kinda dead, she then heard a soft growl, she then grabbed 
her hunter knife running to the infected that was stuck under a desk. 
She stab the head of it killing it, she smirked, as she found the gym. 
As she ran inside looking around seeing no spot of a cart or even 
anything. It was quiet.  She walked inside the gym walking to the 
burning camp fire and threw her bag down on the ground and set down 
started to make some beans with the rabbit she hunted down. She set 
there watching it wear up. The gym had candles all over it to give is 
some light but some of the candles are dying. As it also had some 
blankets laying on the cracks of the bleachers and on the ground.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message info-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="linkblue">

 Constance feel his strong arms pick her up. she honestly felt safe. The
 girl would feel as if she was on top of the world as she rode on his 
back. The child would rest her head on his shoulder, feeling a bit 
restless and tired. She would look at the destruction and death that

the ground, to bone. It made her sick at what she was borne into.</p><p class="center italic">She

tears begin to fill her eyes. “They died two days ago. I’ve been alone 
ever since.” She would look up as the school began to come up from a 
slight distance. She would smile, feeling relieved that they were 
finally here. She would look to her left, startled by a bang on a car 
window. It would be a starved walker, dying for human flesh. She would 
quickly look away, clothing her soft eyes.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message info-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="linkblue">

for a second, " Oh my Lord! Samuel! What the hell happened?! Where's the

Hello there tiny one. " She smiled as she looked back at her ankle 
looking at it, " It look like a mild Twisted ankle with some scrapes.. "
 She said looking at it. As she looked back at the soaked clothes Samuel
 was in as she noticed all the Blood as his clothes dripped down on the 
wooden floor. " Let me take her. You need to sit down and rest.. I will 
patch her up then you.. I got a towel for you to dry your hair.. " She 
handed the towel to the male. As she picked up the girl and set her down
 taking her hand, " Hello! I am Rowan! Do you mind if I take a better 
look at your ankle?

from his mouth, and put his large hand onto hers. She would look around

her arms for the fact that they were now safe. She had nothing to worry 
about. She would give a shy wave, tucking her face closer to sams shirt.
 She was reserved most of the time and wasn’t used to meeting new 
people.</p><p class="center italic"> “It doesn’t hurt much now that im 
not walking on it..” she say with a small smile on her face. She would 
feel the arms of Rowan now wrap around her then setting her down. The 
gorgeous smile of the woman made her light up with joy. “I-I’m Connie.. “
 she would give a shy smile, placing her hands in her lap. The girl

what happened? " She said slowly wiping the dirt off the wound as she

hell- what?” Samara blinked at Mika, reading his face for a long moment 
before she realized both of them were lost. Shaking her head at his 
ashamed look, she didn’t feel like correcting him right now. “I don’t 
think you even know if you have rabies.” She spoke in a more sarcastic 
and joking tone, walking out of the area quickly, not really wanting to 
keep smelling the scent of rotting flesh. Maybe she was going crazy, or 
Mika was just finding a weird side of her. Honestly, she didn’t even 
know why she was laughing so much.</p><p class="center italic"> “Excuse 
me- you aren’t my first friend, mister.” She huffed at him. “Throw some 
glitter around and you’ll make the perfect fairy.” Sam watched him go 
off towards the basketball booth and followed. Watching him like a 
chaperone as she also did her own thing. Finding a vending machine with a
 few things left, she tapped on the glass to make sure it wasn’t 
plastic. Then, she raised a knob of her bat and smashed it into the 
glass, surprised at how less of a shattering sound it made. It was light
 enough that zombies streets away wouldn’t be able to hear. Using her 
fists, she carefully knocked away any excess glass and raided out the 
rest of the machine. Tossing Mika the same type of chips he had eaten 
back at the store.</p><p class="center italic"> Zipping up her backpack,
 she glanced around for anyone or anything nearby. Still not completely 
trusting this place, she glanced at the rides that were still up. She 
narrowed her eyes at the ferris wheel for a moment, then turned back to 
Mika. Making sure she kept a good eye on him and his whereabouts.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/f03e3728f669d2e8fdfb9c11ce5ae95f793ae3car1-199-253v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 The girl would give a small nod with a cheeky smile. She would giggle 
at the woman’s slight humor as he sat there looking at the woman, 
waiting for her to medicate and sanitize her wound. The girl looked at 
the burning fire, watching as the flame moved in the air. It looked so 
free. She would be brought out of her goofing state. “Oh um.. one of 
those things managed to grab me, the twisted my ankle. It was a really

 The feeling Sam got seeing how well Connie took to Roman was foreign to
 him, was it pride? No maybe it was comfort? No that wasn’t it either, 
it was so much more than both of those things.  He couldn’t put his 
finger on any of it, maybe it was just a once in a lifetime thing, or it
 was something he hadn’t felt in ages. Either way it was slowly being 
overpowered by exhaustion.</p><p class="center italic"> Sam limped over 
to where she said the towels were drying his head as quick as he could, 
he got out of eye view of the girls and took off his pants and underwear
 wrapping the towel around his waist tightly. He was fortunate enough to
 not totally ruin his pants today just his shirt, he walked over to the 
fire setting the pants next to it hoping they’d dry. He slowly put 
himself onto the ground laying next to the fire, the warmth felt 
welcoming like a sweet embrace.</p><p class="center italic"> He laid 
there for so long he momentarily nodded off casting himself into a over 
exhausted sleep. Dreams flooded his mind of the life before, how things 
were when birds still sang and cities still teemed with life. Not soon 
after the dream would be invaded by the nightmarish crashing of 
explosions and bombs, Sam shot awake hearing the crashing of rocks down 
one of the halls “Fuck..” he said under his breath quickly grabbing 
Rowans rifle. He took aim at the doorway quickly whispering over to the 
girls “Hide..”</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/bd0682bce31c0b94c43e11cffc93d7bbbd7a0b17r1-408-366v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 “Listen man, I don’t wanna shoot you and I don’t wanna make this any 
harder than it has to be.” Sam said slowly standing up “You don’t have 
to drop the sword but no fucking funny shit” Sam quickly racked the bolt
 on the rifle, granted this wasn’t the best way for him to get the guy 
to trust him it was the only way he’d feel that the girls were safe. He 
wasn’t at his full capacity his leg was still broke to shit but he chose
 to ignore it as he put the weight down onto it. The pain seared through
 his body but he needed a good stance to keep his aim straight. This 
might make him pass out sooner or later but right now the girls were his
 priority.</p><p class="center italic"> Sam kept the rifle shouldered 
and put his hand back to Rowan placing it on her waist “Stand behind me 
and of things go wrong you take Connie and run understood?” His voice 
was commanding but not in a bossy way, it was care and fear all in one. 
“Please do this for me..” His voice was also at a low whisper so the man
 couldn’t hear him.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/bd0682bce31c0b94c43e11cffc93d7bbbd7a0b17r1-408-366v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 Crawling over the wooden creeky ruin looking counter, his hands lifted a
 almost deflated basketball. It was  amusing to see such cool pieces of 
forgotten rumble, his hand  gliding against the bumpy texture  with a 
smile curling from his lips appearing  on his face. He was glad  to have
 a chance of enjoying the carnival  especially  with Sam.</p><p class="center">"Im
 no fairy, im  a demon  of the dumpsters" scuffing out he  tossed the 
ball but it barely even made hoop due to being deflated. As she left him
 alone he was pondering  his  thoughts for quite awhile til he got a 
glimpse of a light reflection  coming from a height  peek up the ferris 
wheel, squinting his eyes and shifting his head towards the direction  
he didn't  understand. What was up there and why was it pointed their 
way?Was it a mirror or a steel beam?The reflecting  sun made it so 
obvious.  It was a small panick that boggled his mind, his thoughts 
racing and his hands growing  a light sweat. He was overthinking the 
situation, believing the ferris  wheel was going to fall from the 
shining he  was in aware of, dropping what he was doing he gathered his 
back off the rigged table upon hearing  Sam's  voice beckon him. His 
hands immediately  shooting up when she tossed him goodies and snagging 
them away in his new bag. He completely  lost interest  in the ferris 
wheel issue when Sam gave him the heads up for being allowed to explore 
abit. He was easily exhilarated  by the freedom of wandering although  
she was treating him  like a dog who needed guardian  activity. "Ah i 
want biscuits"He cooted picking his shot gun back up from the table and 
digging into his left pockey to reveal two red bullets in which he 
loaded the guns barrel before walking down the Carnivals brick path, his
 steps light when trending.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/ea87a99e80cd83aeccc2a29da12cf942c4707c63r1-875-1271v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

explain a lot. Charlotte has a young sister but that was about it. Sadly

turn her head hearing a knock on the door, she didn’t seem to think 
twice about it. Standing up from the table she would walk over to the 
door. Picking up Darcy bag she would move it away from the door. Another
 loud knock would be hear, the girl would stop for a second. Would it be
 a great idea to actually open the door? The girl would reach out to 
unlock the door as once again another loud knock would come from the

The snake slithered back to Jake and crawled up his leg back into

making judgements on the situation. “The one in the halls seems 
harmless... it should be fine. The bigger threat in this area is macho

 Constance would look to see as the woman rushed over towards her in a 
hurry. The girl would give a light smile, rapping her arms around the 
woman tightly. Then warm embrace felt as if it was her mother’s. The 
smell as well, it felt like home. The girl would look up, “No you are.. 
you protected me and sammy. Thank you.” She’d rest her head on her for a
 moment before letting her direct her to a seat. She would give a slight
 glare and sass to the man before feeling the warm bowl of beans in her 
hand. Constance would smell the scent of rich sweet n’ brackish beans 
fill the gym. She would give a giggle of excitement before digging her 
spoon in the beans, nearly finishing it in fourty five seconds. The 
child would let out a sight of comfort as she stretched with a yawn, her

 Charlotte would listen as she was speaking. So it seemed that she 
wasn’t in the military. Nodding her head, having older brothers would 
explain a lot. Charlotte has a young sister but that was about it. Sadly
 she honestly has no idea where she was, “well that explains a lot. I 
don’t think I have heard of Vermont before. Then again I’m not that 
knowledgeable of different groups.</p><p class="center">The girl would 
turn her head hearing a knock on the door, she didn’t seem to think 
twice about it. Standing up from the table she would walk over to the 
door. Picking up Darcy bag she would move it away from the door. Another
 loud knock would be hear, the girl would stop for a second. Would it be
 a great idea to actually open the door? The girl would reach out to 
unlock the door as once again another loud knock would come from the 
outside.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/52ef4d8267acea1072a14ad9fe7cfc2515b27645r1-720-720v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 The girl nodded kicking the stuff aside looking at them, " The name is 
Rowan and yours?" She asked with a smile as she put the gun down putting
 it on safety and sliding it to Samuel. She looked back at them, " As 
long we are cool.. You can come and get a paper plate to eat some of the
 cooked beans.. Just take your stuff and sit down.. " She said as she 
watched the little girl run off to go to sleep. She smiled as she walked

just entered as she slide his stuff to them. " This is Samuel the little

 Rowan handled every situation better than he did, his trust was shit 
and he didn’t like the looks people were giving him. He couldn’t help 
but feel Connie and Rowan were his family now, even tho they’d just all 
met today. He wanted them safe, he wanted them cared for; that was the 
goal. When Rowan sat down next to him he felt a little more at peace 
“Jake he’s about to get the same questions, we’ve had a rough day 
alright?” He sighed trying to keep himself in line “I was almost killed 
by some psycho and had to jump off a bridge, rowan was chased by a 
horde, and Connie watched her family die two days ago.” He felt his 
heart sink “These girls are all I have..” his voice choked up “And I’ll 
be damned if anyone is taking them from me..”</p><p class="center italic">
 Sam grabbed the rifle and cleared it before stacking the mag one last 
time and setting it between him and Rowan. His body was at its limits no
 more getting up, it was up to Rowan now to patch him up “Hey darling I 
know we’ve got a bit going on..” he said softly “But I’m running out of 
fluids here..” he joked about the blood stained to his side. The 
bleeding had stopped a while ago because of the heat from the fire but 
he still needed to have his leg set back right.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/60ab8315b4e2684a6168ac99a59dca29d817ca9br1-1799-1292v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 looked that them with a funny look on their face, did they truly not 
know? It had been twenty-six years since the apocalypse, before Casey 
had been born. “What other hope do we all have if we don’t look out for 
each other from time to time? My mother used to tell me stories of how 
the world used to be. I hope to make the world slowly start to turn. 
Come back to civil and moral filled world. Plus you seem like a nice 
person.” Casey would said as they nodded their head with a big old smile
 on their face, running their fingers through their curly lock of black 
hair. A watch then expect the bullets, before putting them to the side. “
 I apologize, they are probably not the right one, for the gun you have.
 I’ve run into mostly pistols, although I am quite certain they had shot
 gun bullets there or at least use to. You never know who’s scavenging 
nowadays, what will be left.” Casey nodded their head, looking towards 
them.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/981503dd5f91d1d58cc218787f13e458a9151532r1-300-300v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 the things he needed “Remember the guy who was in the store with us?” 
He chuckled to himself the more the thought about it the more ridiculous
 his plan had sounded “Well he tried to kill me and to get away I 
uh...jumped off the bridge..?” He said nervously expecting her so slap 
him</p><p class="center italic"> Sam didn’t wanna say he was scared of 
the old lady but he definitely knew that she’d knock his lights out if 
she hit him right now, but honestly a good nap didn’t sound to bad to 
him right now. But there was more to be done, more people to tend to, 
and he was gonna have to move sooner or later.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/1fb53a2f83beb5d3764e4aa292cb890019f5fb42r1-750-1000v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

go put it away as she came back, " Also nice meeting you! " She smiled 
at him she then handed him a pain killer and a water bottle with some

 When she started to clean his wounds he winced in a little bit of pain,
 after sitting for awhile everything was starting to bruise and get 
sore. He tipped his head back a little bit and let out a soft sight as 
she moved onto his leg, this was the worst part he’d been on it all day 
but now she’s telling him to stay off of it? Fat chance honestly, he’d 
still hobble around the best he could but he wasn’t just gonna sit 
around and do nothing all day. “Even with a missing ear...I say he’s a 
handsome fella..” he winced as he spoke “I had a friend in the army with
 me, we’ve been through hell and back. I haven’t seen him since the fire
 bombs..”</p><p class="center italic"> She introduced herself to him and
 gave the one thing about her, he smiled and took her hand into his “My 
name is Samuel Denver, I’m 20, and I was in the infantry for 2 years 
before the military fell apart..” he raised her hand up kissing the top 
of it before setting it back down. Come on Sam really? Trying to be 
smooth while she’s cleaning your wounds cheap shots man..</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/bd0682bce31c0b94c43e11cffc93d7bbbd7a0b17r1-408-366v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

almost a year. He slowly stood up keeping most of his weight on one side
 and hiding his bad leg for some kind of balance “Lemme go sit guard on 
the roof tonight, I can rest up there.” He said placing a hand on her 
waist to help center himself “I’m broken not useless..” he said sinking

 eyes traced the keys of the beaten up piano she was most familiar with.
 The tuning was off, the keyes were worn down from use, and the wood 
that held it together was starting to rot from damp. Despite all this, 
it still played fine and that's all that mattered. There wasn't much 
sheet music to be had in a place like this so Gwen often found 
themselves making up songs or playing from memory. Gwen focused on the 
tune in their head before their fingers on they keys and starting the 
song. It was called "Photograph" and was from a movie they remembered 
watching a while back called "Her". They didn't remember much about the 
movie at all but the piano music was very sweet which they enjoyed.</p><p class="center italic">The
 slightly out of tune notes made the song sound a lot more eerie than it
 was. Gwen found it kind of funny considering they lived in a post 
apocalyptic world and it spunded like something off the soundtrack for a
 crappy zombie movie. Gwen smiled as thy played and made the tune 
louder. It echoed off the walls of the mall and out the open ceiling. 
One day they hoped the tune would reach someone outside. They'd be lying
 if they said they wanted to be alone in this.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/791bd1e01c52e97716ee539f6187a0b020b5700br1-580-374v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 Ellie watched in apprehension as Ryuto set up the supplies needed to 
treat her wound. She tensed as he held her down, feeling not only 
violated but threatened. With a deep breath, the girl reminded herself 
it was to help her. “Yup,” Ellie muttered in response to Ryuto’s words, 
though through the stress she was feeling she wasn’t sure if he was 
talking to her or Ezra.</p><p class="center"> When the needle pierced 
her skin, Ellie let out a hiss of pain, gritting her teeth. Her hands 
curled into fists and she suddenly had a newfound sympathy for the time 
when her deceased father had gotten impaled five years ago. She hadn’t 
ever been in as much pain as this. She had gotten a chemical burn on her
 left arm (the reason why she got a tattoo there) when she was 15 but 
felt mostly numbness. She had almost died from drowning, too, but she 
was unconscious for most of that. Breathing deeply as Ryuto continued to
 care for her wound, she reminded herself to be more careful as to never
 be in excruciating pain like this again.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="timestamp">

 the metal pole now in their grasp, Gwen looked to see the Clicker 
coming towards them. They let out a cry and threw themselves to their 
feet as the creature came for them. As soon as it got near, they took a 
good swing just like their sister had taught and wacked the thing across
 the face. The clicker stumbled back and screeched. Gwen took this as 
their opportunity to run. Leaving their shoes, they ran for the ladder 
and climbed as quickly as they could until they reached the ground. Up 
on the roof, the Clicker was searching for Gwen but it was too late for 
it.</p><p class="center italic">Gwen took off into the surrounding town 
as soon as they reached the floor. There was no time to lose and with 
the Clicker distracted, they only had a small time frame. The debis 
beneath Gwen's feat dug in through their socks as they ran but that 
didn't matter right now. They desperately looked around for somewhere to
 hide and that's when they spotted the swewer lid. Perfect. Gwen dashed 
to it and it was already half opened. They dug their metal pole into the
 side and pushed it open with all the strength they could muster. It 
took a few tries but the cap eventually came off and a ladder was 
viewable. Gwen let out a sigh and took of their bag. Unzipping it, they 
looked through their small ammount of supplies to find a torch. They 
smiled at it before pulling it out and zipping their bag back up. It was
 probably going to be disgusting down their but Gwen was already pretty 
messy themselves so it didn't matter anymore. They turned on their light
 and put the bag back on their shoulders, grabbed their pole and headed 
down the ladder to the sewers.</p><p class="center italic">The darkness 
was illuminated by the torch but it wasn't enough to see very far. The 
hairs on Gwen's neck rose as they shone their torch around at the 
bottom. The smell of the place was disgusting but they continued down 
and began walking.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><!----><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/fa864245e06687f80bf5f74aaca464d49881d491r1-605-624v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 wandered around the sewers for a little while. Their torch was 
beginning to run out of battery and their toes were growing numb from 
the cold of the sewer water and damp. Just when they thought they lost 
hope, they saw light at the end of the tunnel — literally. A grin made 
its way to Gwen's face as they began to approach the light cautiously. 
It could be a trap but they wouldn't know until they got there. Gwen got
 to the end of the tunnel they were in and peaked around the corner to 
the next one. Just a meter away was a person sat cooking meat on a fire.</p><p class="center italic">Gwen's
 eyes windened. This was the first time they'd seen someone since their 
dad died and their sister went missing. Without saying a word, Gwen 
turned off their torch and turned the corner without thinking. The 
thought of talking to another person didn't make them stop to think if 
they were hostile or not. Gwen shuffled closer until they were within 
view of the person. They kept quiet and obsevered for a few seconds 
before speaking up. "Hello?" They let out, just above a whisper.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message info-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="linkblue">

 sound of muffled footsteps down a dirty sidewalk brought on no 
disturbance. A young woman no older looking than 19 was wandering with 
intentions hidden behind her jeweled eyes. She was quick, silent, and 
wary.</p><p>Her eyes were ever so often continuing to droop. Exhaustion 
ran rampant in her expression, drained from a previous encounter 
involving an ambush. Kyo had handled herself well enough, but fatigue 
and scrapes along her face, arms, and legs gave away she was recently in
 a fight for her life.</p><p>The girl’s face rose when the smell of a 
campfire brought her attention. Smoke was rising from behind a 
supermarket, indicating intelligent life.</p><p>Sharp features grew 
serious, warranting a retrieval of her sidearm from her concealed 
holster. Another survivor trying to live day by day or a scavenger

considering the metal pole and torch in their hands but they did it

 can work with a knife,” she responded, almost automatically. Ayuri 
leans over to check the man’s pulse on his neck, and finds that there’s 
still something beating very faintly. She wasn’t made to heal. She was 
trained to be a war machine. But first aid was always something you 
needed in battle so she supposed she could help just a bit.</p><p class="center">She
 looked over at Ario when he said ‘madam.’ A weird and unnecessary 
mannerism, considering the fact that she had already told him her name. 
Besides, madam was usually indicated toward the higher up classes, which
 she tilted her head at. Strange.</p><p class="center">Things got more 
odd when she noticed an expression cross his face. She couldn’t tell 
what it was, but it looked like an expression her brother had done when 
she almost broke an arm trying to complete a mission. When Ario got up 
and started walking, she snapped out of her thoughts and squints at him.
 ‘He looks like someone that was assigned a mission from the major,’ 
Ayuri thought as she applied a bit more pressure onto the wound, waiting
 for the heated knife.</p><p class="bolder center">═══◄•๑♣︎๑•►════</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/fa864245e06687f80bf5f74aaca464d49881d491r1-605-624v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

They were set water and food wise however, more wouldn't  hurt to have.

 it smelt racheted. He held a distaste for  it all, yawning, his hand 
fanned over his mouth while he was scanning the dead for some neat gear,
 shuffling his hand into some pockets when squating at ground level. The
 warm weather was terrible for the stench but it was best to pretend to 
be unbothered.</p><p class="center"> Reelimg a hand back into his bag, 
he revealed a pocket knife he used to cut away at loose pockets in which
 were covered in gore that he wished to keep his hands off of. He had 
morals and reframed form defiling the corpses before he finished. All 
that was found was a packet of gum best not eaten and a few coins that  
were useless in the new pandemic  of the world "What a buzz"  scolding 
he dropped the coins  to the floor with a light click as they clashed to
 the ground  and the pack of gum with a thud, his hand putting away his

let alone trusting them. Sure, he was offering free protection but there
 had to be a twist to it, right? Nothing was just up for grabs; 
everything had a price to pay.</p><p>Glancing to the guy that offered 
her bandages, she narrowed her eyes. “Shouldn’t you keep them for 
yourself?” She felt it was almost shady to give up bandages for a 
stranger. “I’m not willing to give up anything I have in my pack for 
them.” She defended, scooting her bag closer to herself.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/00630979e6de76e729fff12979acaedae7e56936r1-500-500v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 looked to Daniel and broke out into a cynical little laugh. Wiping a 
tear from her eye, she shook her head. Her next statement came off 
harsher than anticipated. “You’re naive.” Sighing, she wondered just 
exactly how anyone can go and give away their limited items. “Giving 
your supplies to strangers is practically letting us walk all over you.”
 Her eyes seemed to sadden for just a second, turning away.</p><p>Her 
mother gave away supplies just like him. It lead straight to her demise.
 While Kyo was out on a supply run, talk had gone around that her mother
 would give to those that need it. A group of thieves stopped by the 
door one night. The sight when she came home- the scream she let out. 
She couldn’t even look at her own hands, those hands covered in her own 
mother’s blood, cradling her and muttering how awful she was to leave 
her alone. She was only 13 then.</p><p>Kyo had grown quiet; she picked 
her head up when mentioning of her prone to getting hurt struck her 
nerves. Making a face, she childishly stuck her tongue out at him. 
“Asshole.” She mumbled under her breath, crossing her arms.</p><p>Narrowing
 her eyes, she stomped over. “I’m taking these bandages out of spite. 
Not because you want to give them to me.” She made sure that was clear 
before grabbing them. Her expression ever so slightly lightened when she
 rewrapped the bandages onto her hand.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/133edf472bef26ff2c15aaee9384ba7fbc2a39eer1-448-326_68.gif" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 the last stitch was done and the thread was cut, Ezra happily leaned 
back to let Ryuto take over. The stitches weren't half as perfect as 
those Eva had performed on him, but they were pretty neat for a life 
threatening stabbing wound in the lower side, if he could say so 
himself.</p><p class="center">The blood on his fingers was already 
starting to dry up, and yet some of the red liquid still trickled down 
his fingers, only to speckle a few, almost aesthetic circles onto the 
old stone floor.</p><p class="center">Ezra tried to ignore Ellie's 
pained grimaces, just as the feeling of sickness that seemed to slowly 
creep up inside of his throat, by busying himself with his backpack. One
 small pocket at thr side was still open, the one where Ryuto had taken 
the needle and thread from, but that wasn't what he was after.</p><p class="center">It
 was hard to grasp around with his bloody fingers, not even mentioning

 Ellie gritted her teeth harder, hurting them so much she thought they 
would break. The pain was excruciating and tears pricked in the corner 
of her eyes but she forced herself to keep quiet and bear the pain. 
Soon, it was over and she sighed with relief as bandages were wrapped 
over her wound.</p><p class="center"> Ellie watched with confusion as 
Ezra pulled out a flask. She let out a light chuckle and sat up as Ezra 
spoke with hesitation. “I don’t think it matters in an apocalypse,” 
Ellie replied as she slipped on her backpack. Ellie had only ever lived 
in this apathetic world but from the stories her dad told her, the world
 used to be much better than this.</p><p class="center"> Ellie pulled a 
map out of her back pocket and unfolded it. Her fingers traced the paper
 until she tapped on one spot. “Abby,” She muttered angrily to herself, 
“I’m coming.”</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/145fe5907ffa58351bfe8655b52d4e8e90f16b67r1-1264-2048v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 The small child would flutter her eyes open, feeling the burn of 
sunshine hit them directly. She would sit up, itching and rubbing at her
 eyes before giving a good stretch. Connie would wiggle her foot, 
noticing the pain in her ankle starting to go away. She would smile 
cutely before standing up. The child would exit from the bleachers, 
going towards the fire to warm her hands. She would then, make her way 
to Rowan with a smile, jumping on her back. “RAHH!!” shed scream trying 
to scare her. She would get off before looking at her with a cheeky 
smile. “Morning Rowan! I slept like a cloud, breezing in the wind!” She

 Ellie shook her head at Ezra holding out the liquor, refusing it. She 
didn’t want it, at all. She didn’t need to be messing with her body when
 it was in this condition and although she was no lightweight, she 
didn’t want to risk messing with her thoughts either.</p><p class="center">
 Ellie’s gaze flickered from the map to Ezra as he grabbed her. With a 
curl of her lip, she shoved his hand off and stood up. She was thinner 
and smaller than Ezra, but she still appeared somewhat intimidated as 
she snarled, “No, she can’t wait. She’ll be moving while I rest and I

 his grandfather had died not a single tear left his eye. All he could 
do watch and stare blankly as his grandfather sipped the tea down. His 
grandfather was right death IS merciful. It was better than living in 
pain in this cruel world. Now it was just him the only one he had left 
was gone. His grandfather had become old and weary which made survival 
difficult. Isn’t better to take your life rather than at the hands of 
the undead?</p><p class="italic center">Closing his eyes as his fingers 
guided him around the keys he was reminded of the time when the place 
was much more alive. Ever since he old metal sign on the roof had 
started to rust no one would come here anymore.</p><p class="italic center">H&amp;H’s Cafe and Trading Centre</p><p class="italic center">That
 is what the sign would say but now it’s barely visible from all the 
rust. This place was once so lively as his grandfather would offer food 
in exchange of supplies. It wouldn’t even surprise him anymore if the 
cabin was just forgotten. Maybe it’s for the best it would the dead and 
the living from finding him.</p><p class="italic center">As he continued
 to play the peaceful piece gently and slowly he started to close his

fluid she happened to find in the hospital during her clearing of the 
first floor of the ward she claimed as “home” for the past week.</p><p>Yanking

bed “good boy Ryker..” she said softly to the Australian Shepard who 
kept a watchful eye on her.</p><p>Letting out a soft yawn she stood from
 the bed and walked to the window as the small horde made its way past

She turned from the window slipping on her brown leather jacket and 
making her way towards the door. “Let’s go Rykes” the pup lifting his 
head from the bed and jumping off the bed making his way to her side

couldn't get any food, so she returned to her home to sleep as it had

 The girl would stare Rowan in her eyes. She had a look of joy on her 
face. Maybe it was the fact that she managed to survive another day. The
 child would give a small nod, reaching for the peaches, slurping them 
down. They were her favorite fruit after all. When the mention of a gun 
came up, the room would grow silent. The child was PETRIFIED of guns, 
she hated them. The loud noise, the fact that they can kill anyone at 
anytime just by the press of a button, she hated all of it. She would 
gulp a peach down before looking to the woman. Her knees were beginning 
to bounce uncontrollably as she hesitated to say, “Oh.. okay. Can’t 
wait..” the child would lie with a fake smile before continuing to eat 
her peaches.</p><p class="center italic"> Connies knees would stop 
bouncing. She tried her best getting the thought out of her head, 
eventually doing so. “Can we try to find some toys? Oh please, please 
Mrs. Rowan!” She would give dad, puppy dog eyes, trying to influence 
her.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/00630979e6de76e729fff12979acaedae7e56936r1-500-500v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 The girl would squeal in excitement as the woman answered her question 
with a yes. It was really a “maybe” but, Connie says that maybes always 
ends with a yes. The child would finish her last peach before standing 
up with a smile. She would look to the woman before letting out with

 off to a camping bag, stuffing clothes, a ripped picture of her mother,
 father, brothers as well as her on a fares wheel. The girl would sit 
there looking at it with a smile, missing them. She would give the

 The child would nod as the woman walked off, patting her head and 
grabbing her stuff. The child would stare at her bloody shoes, thinking 
she should wash them off once they got back. The girl would turn around,
 hearing the light footsteps of Rowan. Connie would smile cheekily, 
excited for the run. She wanted to be brave, take action, protect and 
take care of Rowan like she does for her. The girl would giggle as the 
hat was put on, “Look at me, I’m Rowan! I’m serious and brave.” She 
would mock the woman, puffing up her chest in the air, crossing her arms
 in a serious stance. She would giggle, eventually stopping. The 
freckled girl would look to her, giving a nod, “I think we should wait 
for Mr. Sam. Is he still sleeping?” She tilt her head, inquisitive and 
curious.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/6a2ba3c2f28c4165c2a488bd83e358ba6dc10859r1-750-1334v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 The child would nod as the woman walked off, patting her head and 
grabbing her stuff. The child would stare at her bloody shoes, thinking 
she should wash them off once they got back. The girl would turn around,
 hearing the light footsteps of Rowan. Connie would smile cheekily, 
excited for the run. She wanted to be brave, take action, protect and 
take care of Rowan like she does for her. The girl would giggle as the 
hat was put on, “Look at me, I’m Rowan! I’m serious and brave.” She 
would mock the woman, puffing up her chest in the air, crossing her arms
 in a serious stance. She would giggle, eventually stopping. The 
freckled girl would look to her, giving a nod, “I think we should wait 
for Mr. Sam. Is he still sleeping?” She tilt her head, inquisitive and 
curious.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/f4573025910ad9b95dcf3f72b812b8ab1d7e37d2r1-720-682v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 Charlotte would turn her head hearing gunshot after gunshot. The bloody
 cries of the monsters. Turning her head she would look for Darcy. 
Seeing her run over, with a couple of them behind her. The girls eyes 
went wide. She needed to do something, anything to help. She would move 
to the side holding the gun in hand. She had a dead set point at one of 
the walkers. She can do this, it’s not that hard right? She played R6 
and COD before- but that’s nothing like holding a real gun. They were 
just video games,</p><p class="center">The girl would watch as one of 
the walkers would reach out for Darcy,   Pulling on the trigger the 
bullet would fly through the air landing in the walkers head. The body 
would fly- she did it. She actually shot one. But right now wasn’t the 
time to celebrate. No they needed to get out of here. Looking around for
 anything, a car, bike- she couldn’t see shit. Damn it, was it possible 
for them to get out on foot?</p><p class="center">Waiting for Darcy to 
come over a couple of the walkers were not far behind. The girl would 
look over, in all honestly rather lost. She always stayed at home, 
running away from these things was not her ‘specialty’. Her eyes would 
dart around once again, looking for anything at this point. Squinting 
her eyes it’s seemed to be a small punch buggy sitting on the road. It 
had both windows smashed out, and she didn’t even know if there was gas 
or a pair of keys in the car; but it was worth pointing it out. “Darcy 
there is a small car over there, I would say about a 10 minute run away 
from us. Should we go to it or just keep running?” She wasn’t sure what 
to do, last time she did something on her own thinking it lead to a 
walker pulling her out of her own home.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/76d23f99d7c36d4c579c457650b23d45616e3018r1-640-640v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 scanned the desolate streets with a blank expression. He didn't know 
what he was doing, but he couldn't be in that building anymore. For some
 reason being stuck in one place exacerbated his paranoia significantly,
 he didn't know why. Heck he didn't even know why he felt so paranoid in
 the first place. Maybe it was the  result of his mind being on 
overdrive he didn't know nor did he care. He didn't matter, no one does 
in comparison to the all mighty; humans are so tiny which is weird 
because they think they are so important.</p><p>Raphael just turned to 
the left and started walking, he wasn't going anywhere in particular, 
just walking. Slowly, he made his way down the street, gladly he felt

to form a coherent thought. He doubted it'd last long though. It never

She asked looking at the girl. She laughed at the girl mocking her. She 
grab her bag throwing it over her shoulder, " Ready to go? " She asked 
the young then grab her hand walking out of gym and then school, " Want

 Charlotte would turn her head hearing gunshot after gunshot. The bloody
 cries of the monsters. Turning her head she would look for Darcy. 
Seeing her run over, with a couple of them behind her. The girls eyes 
went wide. She needed to do something, anything to help. She would move 
to the side holding the gun in hand. She had a dead set point at one of 
the walkers. She can do this, it’s not that hard right? She played R6 
and COD before- but that’s nothing like holding a real gun. They were 
just video games,</p><p class="center">The girl would watch as one of 
the walkers would reach out for Darcy,   Pulling on the trigger the 
bullet would fly through the air landing in the walkers head. The body 
would fly- she did it. She actually shot one. But right now wasn’t the 
time to celebrate. No they needed to get out of here. Looking around for
 anything, a car, bike- she couldn’t see shit. Damn it, was it possible 
for them to get out on foot?</p><p class="center">Waiting for Darcy to 
come over a couple of the walkers were not far behind. The girl would 
look over, in all honestly rather lost. She always stayed at home, 
running away from these things was not her ‘specialty’. Her eyes would 
dart around once again, looking for anything at this point. Squinting 
her eyes it’s seemed to be a small punch buggy sitting on the road. It 
had both windows smashed out, and she didn’t even know if there was gas 
or a pair of keys in the car; but it was worth pointing it out. “Darcy 
there is a small car over there, I would say about a 10 minute run away 
from us. Should we go to it or just keep running?” She wasn’t sure what 
to do, last time she did something on her own thinking it lead to a 
walker pulling her out of her own home.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="timestamp">

behind seeing some of the dead following from behind, " We can also got 
to the Flower shop as well! " She said with glee, " We just need to kill

 was busy looting an old house looking for anything he could take back 
to the group. He did his best to avoid any infected individuals and 
stuck to the shadows to avoid being seen. “As much as I hate to admit 
it, I need those people even if they don’t need or want me” he thought 
to himself as he searched. He came up on a household medkit buried in a 
closet and was overjoyed. He then stood up and leaned his head back,

 The girl would feel the heavy weapon in the palm of her hands. Her 
heart would begin to beat rapidly. She was terrified to accidentally 
hold it the wrong way, causing her to pull the trigger. Suddenly, a 
spark grew inside her. She realized how Rowan was making sure to protect
 not only herself, but as well as Connie. Constance would suddenly get a
 feeling of inspiration for how caring the woman was. She made sure to 
put her life on the line to protect others. The small child would give a
 nod, “Yes ma’am!” She’d respond with a determined tone in her voice. 
She would point the gun towards the opposite direction of the zombies. 
Making sure to keep on watch if any of those freaks were coming from 
that direction. The gun would shake in her hands uncontrollably as sweat
 dropped from her face. She felt a bit nauseous, frightened to waste 
bullets as well as afraid of those brainless monsters getting ahold of 
her.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/52ef4d8267acea1072a14ad9fe7cfc2515b27645r1-720-720v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 Quinn lifted her head out if a box and was about to dive into another, 
until she noticed a woman standing in the streets. Quinn waved back and 
walked over to the woman. As she got closer, she noticed that the woman 
was armed with a gun. Quinn knew this was a high risk situation, but the
 woman had already been watching her, so she figured if the woman wanted
 to kill her she already would’ve.</p><p class="center"> Quinn got close
 enough to the woman to where she didn’t have to scream, but kept her 
distance incase the woman tried to pull a fast one. “Hey, I’m Quinn” She
 introduced herself. “What’s your name? And is there a safe house near 
here?” Quinn had only talked to her parents before, so she didn’t know 
how to talk to other people just yet.</p><p class="center"> Quinn 
studied the woman, keeping a mental note of her. She looked to be in her
 mid 20s, maybe late 20s. She also had blonde hair. The woman looked 
friendly, but looks can be deceiving in this world.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/f4573025910ad9b95dcf3f72b812b8ab1d7e37d2r1-720-682v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 The girl would smile as they both entered the store. She would look at 
all the toys, some stained with blood, others broken to pieces. She 
would frown, wondering how they looked before broken to pieces. 
Suddenly, passing an isle, she would notice a stuffed doll. It was 
perfect the girl would smile, reach for it, it was on a shelf about the 
same height as her. It had red puffy hair, ruffled pink dress with a 
stitched sun hat. The girl would hug it before mumbling, “perfect..” she
 would look at the doll in its cotton blue eyes, “hm.. I’m gonna name 
you.. Lu Lu!” She would hug the doll, twirling in circles, “I can’t wait
 to play with you Lu Lu!” Abruptly, as she turned she’d see a mouth 
foamed walker pouncing on Rowan. The girl would scream, dropping the 
doll on the cold hard floor. Her eyes would dilate as she stood there, 
frozen in fear. ‘grab the gun’ , ‘grab the gun!’ The constant thought 
would come to mind but.. she was just so scared. But when she heard 
Rowan say it.. her eyes looking at Connie, her life depending on the 
girl.. an inferno eagerness went through her body. An electricity. She 
couldn’t explain it.. it just was there. The girl would jump to the 
cart, pulling out the heavy gun, she would flip it to the air, glaring 
at the infected in the eyes. “GET YOUR FILTHY HANDS OFF MRS. ROWAN!!” 
she’d scream out in anger, no longer shaking, no longer afraid, no 
longer scared. She was determined to kill it. She was determined to save
 her. The girl would take three shots, a line gowing straight up its 
body from its thigh to its head. Of course she missed a few but once she
 took the shot at the thigh, she made sure not to miss again. She shot 
again at its head out of anger, realizing that she wasted all of the 
last bullets. Connie would fall on her knees ( 1/2 )</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/516432b413a57f15cadf7df90f43a03db0dc45acv2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 his grandfather had died not a single tear left his eye. All he could

grandfather was right death IS merciful. It was better than living in 
pain in this cruel world. Now it was just him the only one he had left 
was gone. His grandfather had become old and weary which made survival 
difficult. Isn’t better to take your life rather than at the hands of 
the undead?</p><p class="italic center">Closing his eyes as his fingers

cabin was just forgotten. Maybe it’s for the best it would the dead and 
the living from finding him.</p><p class="italic center">As he continued

 would turn her head as Darcy would push the car idea out if the way. I 
mean it was worth bring up, the girl would then point out the hotel. 
Seemed like a good idea, nodding her head she would see the walkers 
getting closer, more coming to add. She would do as told running to the 
hotel, the front door had to be open- right? Reaching out for the handle
 the door won’t more. Damn it- she would reach for the second door, it 
didn’t seem to the more either. Her eyes would fill with panic, no it 
needed to open. Pulling on it once more the door would fly open. Yes! 
Running in she would close it behind her and Darcy. Looking up she would
 ask, “should we barricade the door? Then go to the higher level and 
shoot them from there. Or let them come from the front?”</p><p class="center">Turning
 ones head there would be a front lobby decks, then a set on stair cases
 going to the higher levels. The hotel must have had 3-4 levels, being 
rather large. She had never gone into the hotel, being to scared to 
explore. But just as she seemed to ask this question the sound of glass 
breaking was heard. The back door- an arm would reach out for the two of
 them. Not being able to break the door down, just the glass. They 
needed to act- fast. Charlotte would run over grabbing a chair from the 
hotel Lobby, putting it up against the door. That should keep the door 
closed. But for the hand- grabbing a fallen piece of floor board the 
girl would gab the hand back. The walker getting angry as she would do 
so. Turning the floor board around it seemed to have a sharp end. 
Through the glass hole the girl would stab it into the walkers face. 
Taking out its eyes. That should buy them some time. Right?</p><p class="center">She would then turn back to Darcy, she was leaving it up to her for the plan, she was the one with experience after all.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/76d23f99d7c36d4c579c457650b23d45616e3018r1-640-640v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 Constance would sit there feeling a numb feeling. She knows she didn’t 
kill a real human being but.. they once were alive. Probably had kids, a
 job, parents, friends.. a life. A life worth living. The girl would 
soon snap out of her phase, hearing the calming voice and comfort of 
Rowan. The child would also hear the female talking to the doll in a 
humorous way. It put a slight smile on her face. The child would stand 
up, still shaking. She would look to lulu with a smile, “Sorry for 
dropping you lulu, hope it didn’t hurt much.” She would look to the 
ground, tucking her hair behind her ear. She would look back to the dead
 infected female laying on the floor. Blood poured out of her dirty 
stained dress, as well as the shot that went through her eyeball. She 
somehow had a.. a almost peaceful look on her face as if she was at rest
 from this hell of a world. The girl would wrap her arms around Rowan as
 she lifted her from the floor. She would shut her eyes, trying to shut 
out the banging from the starving zombies wanting to eat at the two.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/f4573025910ad9b95dcf3f72b812b8ab1d7e37d2r1-720-682v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 The female kept the head of the Infected out of her way trying to get 
bit. The howls and screams it made as they drool came running down its 
chin to her shirt. She  then heard Bang Bang Bang. Turning her head to 
the young girl. Her heart was racing thinking she could of died but 
Connie saved her. She turned her full attention to the young girl soon 
standing up as she noticed the girl crying, " It's okay.. It's Okay.. 
You did she good thing. " She kneeled down grabbing hold of lulu, " Lulu
 this little girl saved my life she's a tiny little super hero! Nothing 
can touch her I am telling you nothing.. " She smiled handed the girl 
the doll and hugged at the same time. She off course had the blood of 
the infected on her. The female looked at her, " That is the number one 
reason you wear the adventure hat.. Killing thoses damn Infected. " She 
smile at the young girl. She heard the howls and banging of the infected
 at the door as they must of heard the gun shots and yelling, " Let's 
get going sweetie.. " She said once standing up picking the young girl 
up and her toy.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/5cffdbd651cdc4424423ef60b36122cc1be39c81r1-768-901v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 Crawling over the wooden creeky ruin looking counter, his hands lifted a
 almost deflated basketball. It was  amusing to see such cool pieces of 
forgotten rumble, his hand  gliding against the bumpy texture  with a 
smile curling from his lips appearing  on his face. He was glad  to have
 a chance of enjoying the carnival  especially  with Sam.</p><p class="center">"Im
 no fairy, im  a demon  of the dumpsters" scuffing out he  tossed the 
ball but it barely even made hoop due to being deflated. As she left him
 alone he was pondering  his  thoughts for quite awhile til he got a 
glimpse of a light reflection  coming from a height  peek up the ferris 
wheel, squinting his eyes and shifting his head towards the direction  
he didn't  understand. What was up there and why was it pointed their 
way?Was it a mirror or a steel beam?The reflecting  sun made it so 
obvious.  It was a small panick that boggled his mind, his thoughts 
racing and his hands growing  a light sweat. He was overthinking the 
situation, believing the ferris  wheel was going to fall from the 
shining he  was in aware of, dropping what he was doing he gathered his 
back off the rigged table upon hearing  Sam's  voice beckon him. His 
hands immediately  shooting up when she tossed him goodies and snagging 
them away in his new bag. He completely  lost interest  in the ferris 
wheel issue when Sam gave him the heads up for being allowed to explore 
abit. He was easily exhilarated  by the freedom of wandering although  
she was treating him  like a dog who needed guardian  activity. "Ah i 
want biscuits"He cooted picking his shot gun back up from the table and 
digging into his left pockey to reveal two red bullets in which he 
loaded the guns barrel before walking down the Carnivals brick path, his
 steps light when trending.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/bd0682bce31c0b94c43e11cffc93d7bbbd7a0b17r1-408-366v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 whistle came from the Male's  puckered lips. He couldn't  bare the pure
 silence after he had finally spoken to a live human. It was nice, 
making his heart rather fuzzy. He was fairly  short standing in at 5'3 
he was able to duck and sneak into smaller booths, rummaging  in a 
delightful  mood until he jerked his head up hearing the crispy cracks 
beneath someones feet. He assumed they were alone but it seemed there 
was company lurking  around, peeking from  the booth he cocked his gun 
into fire and stepped around. The prettu melodious  humming he had came 
to an end immediately  when scooting  the carnival  grounds. "hello?" 
soft and curious  his voice beckoned out while he was searching, maybe 
it was a dog? or was it all in his head?</p><p class="center">"Uh, woof 
woof?" chimming out with a tag of lively laugher he treaded fastly 
looking around, his bag chimming from all the teasures he kept to 
himself. "i have dog treats. it's  okay." his hands  lifted the worn 
rags from old rigged tables searchinh around.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><!----><li class="chat-message info-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="linkblue">

“Clearly.” She nodded to Mika as he called himself the ‘demon of the 
dumpsters’. Sam clapped at the deflated ball hitting the group with a 
pathetic look. Raising a brow at his look, he seemed to noticing the 
thing at the top of the ferris wheel as well. But she would only worry 
about it if it happened to be a threat. “If you find any biscuits, let 
me know. And if there’s any trouble with anything, yell for me. I’ll 
stay nearby.”</p><p class="center italic"> As Mika walked off in one 
direction, she went off the other. Stopping at an old ring toss game for
 goldfish, she sat onto the counter and pulled out a bag of chips. 
Taking a few bites, she lightly swayed her legs and looked off at the 
distance. Wondering if she could catch any fish off of the pier for them
 to eat tonight. If she could find a fishing rod and maybe some bait, 
that is. Hopping down off the counter after a couple more minutes of 
sitting there, she traveled onto find something else.</p><p class="center italic">
 Finding another wrecked stand, she crawled inside and found an 
umbrella. Moving all of her things into the bigger bag she had found a 
bit ago, she placed it onto her shoulders with the umbrella inside. Then
 went off to continue looking. She wasn’t all too interested in the 
carnival itself right now, just what it could offer her and Mika. 
Twirling her switchblade around her hand like a nervous habit, she found
 a water gun stand. Sitting down, she tried the trigger and a sad stream
 of water forced itself out for a moment. “Wow, not even the pump water 
guns will work.”</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/user-icon-placeholder.png" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

letting him take a peek. He always thought artist viewed  their work 
like nudes yet they were so open to share, lifting his head with a 
blissful smile "Ah, its wonderful. Can i watch you draw for awhile?" 
acknowledging  their   reasoning  for coming here before jumping into 
doing things. Mika and his one track mind were easily amused, tapoing 
his foot lightly against the brick floor when observing  the sketch

pondering if exposing his name was the best "Im mikaela but you can call

was just sitting on the counters of the next ripped up stand she found, 
closer to the entrance of the carnival. She was happily enjoying the 
silence and making her hunger go away by a bit. But that silence was 
quickly broken away by someone who spoke out a “Hello”. Then introduced 
himself as a Priest of a church. She instantly didn’t trust this guy, 
being that most people she met throughout the last few years had tried 
to steal her things or harm her. The only person she knew she could 
trust was Mika. Hopefully this person wasn’t cold blooded or found 
Mikaela yet.</p><p class="center italic"> She silently slid off of the 
counter and kept her nail-littered bat with her. Looking down at the 
bloodstained weapon with small scraps of the remains of other people on 
it, she wondered if she would have to kill this person too. She hoped 
not, but knew her instincts would make her do it if she felt overly 
threatened. Making her way towards a food stand near the Priest, Sam 
stayed low and as quiet as she could. Peeking out where the sun would 
cover her, she tried to spot any weapons on this person. Mainly just 
wanting to watch him for a moment before she chose what to do.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="timestamp">

look to her hand, what Charlotte didn’t bring up yet was the fact she 
was actually pretty skilled in medical. Seeing two pieces of glass 
Charlotte would squint her eyes. She would rip off a piece of her shirt,
 it seemed to be the best material for temporarily wrapping it. She

 Mika's  eyes narrowed towards the hand, he was born during the 
apocalypse so he never really knew much on the beginning human customs 
so it was no wonder he got exhilarated from small things. He learned a 
majority of his education  from his parents before his dad shot his mom 
and  off themselves  with a hoard of zombies summoned from the fire. His
 human interaction  was a good portion  of his teen years before being 
alone for a majority of his upcoming  adult  years. As he examined their
 hand he slowly imitated  Harris and placed it ontop of theirs "If you 
wanted me to hold your hand, you could've  just told me" he spoke in a 
giddy tone when interwining his fingers against theirs but released 
quickly as he got distracted.</p><p class="center">"Oh almost forgot 
this"Mentioning, his hand grabbed ahold of his shot gun and used the 
strap to hang it across his chest. A short, unruly blonde hair young man
 with a hoarding amount  of stuff in his hip bag. Wandering behind 
Harris to continue  the conversation. Mika held a sweet voice, soft on  
the ears however, when angered he could be a little prick sometimes.</p><p class="center">Observing
  the man pour  dark fluid from their flask, a nervous sweat like 
bullets  drew from Mikas face. Did the man not like him? Was he going to
  posion him for being annoying? All this overthinking  questions were 
immediately  extinguished  like a flame. As harris reassured him the 
drink was fine while he settled down in a old  rusty steel fold chair, 
lifting the cup to his lips after he watched harris take a chug at it, 
he was relieved. Covering his parted plush lips against  the lid and 
shifting his gaze away while he took a long sip. He was so cautious 
seemingly  nerved in wide open spaces. "My companion  says people kill 
others, have you ever killed someone? isn't  that wrong on the mind?" he
 spoke senselessly after he remembered what sam told him earlier</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/00630979e6de76e729fff12979acaedae7e56936r1-500-500v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

into his bag to reveal a book  where he neatly hid the drawing away so 
it wouldn't  get ruined and placing it back in the bag. He adored the 
piece and that emotion  was clearly expressed on his face. "Thank you so
 much Harris" remarking, he was comfortable in their presences, 
returning his hand in his bag he pulled a pack of old color pencils and 
handed them over. He was a scavenger  for  unnecessary  items and felt 
like Harris deserved  something  in return. After all, he did take their
 tea and polished it like it was his last drink. Observing Harris's  
actions he frantically  got up almost falling from the chair with his 
hand ripping his gun up from  the floor  so he wouldn't  leave it 
behind.</p><p class="center">"Do you have to leave?" chimming in, a saddwned tone racked his voice when he got up to stand by harris.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/2c11c208a784c4074d19c7b5789af83ccf78f2a3r1-512-512v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 eyed the boat with a twinkle in her eye. So, not only was she able to 
ride along in a truck but she’d also get the chance to ride on a boat? 
This had to be the best day for transportation she’s had yet. Walking 
uses energy and horses need maintaining.</p><p>She looked at the water 
and took a hesitant step back. She didn’t exactly know how to swim- her 
parents were far too busy trying to repair what they could or salvage 
supplies for food and water; they didn’t think they’d end up offed so 
soon into her life.</p><p>Heading to the log, she kept her balance while
 crossing. There were a few close calls- the girl grabbing onto a spare 
branch and gasping while catching herself. Sighing in relief, she hopped
 off of the moss-layered log and headed towards Leander.</p><p>“How’d 
you even manage to get ahold of one of these?” She questioned, glancing 
towards his hands. Did he end up cutting himself in the truck?</p><p>“And
 thanks for the panic back there at the truck.” She knit her eyebrows, 
elbowing him lightly in the shoulder. “For a second, I thought you’d 
gotten bit.” Smirking, she didn’t expect an invitation honestly. It was a
 dog eat dog world and it meant less danger if she could accompany 
someone.</p><p>“Rocks for brains or not, I’m starting to think you’ve 
got some freak luck somewhere hidden. First a shambler, then a horde- 
you know what, I think you’re just bad luck now.” Shrugging, she

 wind blew cold on this silent night, with only the soft rustle of 
leaves to fill ones ears. It had been twenty six years since the world 
grew loud with screams, such silence as this was rare, but easy to find

 25, she was part of the people who grew in the apocalypse and were 
basically molded by the rules and conditions of it. She had a lot of

many other things, she knew a lot but this made it hard for her to 
specialise in anything apart from welding. She had very few memories 
that weren't horrible or in which she wasn't struggling to survive, she 
was taught how to survive and how to be efficient in every way</p><p class="italic center">

 It was the night before Joel’s death and the community Ellie was in had
 thrown a party, unknowing of the pain that would be felt tomorrow. This
 was also the night when Ellie’s deceased girlfriend, who then was only 
her best friend, had kissed her. In front of hundreds of people, at the 
party. It had caused a homophobic man to approach them and call the two 
of them a slur. Ellie had jumped into action straight away, ready to 
hurl insults back, but Joel had stepped in and shoved the man away from 
Ellie and her girlfriend.</p><p class="center italic"> As soon as the

Joel was not only her father but her best friend and she was terrified

with an irritated glance back at her father, she stormed off.</p><p class="center">
 The pain wreaked havoc in Ellie’s heart. It hurt her so much tears 
began to fall from her eyes. Maybe if she had been kinder to him, he 
wouldn’t have taken on extra patrols and encountered his murderer. Maybe
 if Ellie had gone with him, she could have saved him. It was all her 
fault. All her fucking fault and if she couldn’t at least kill not only 
her father’s murderer, but the woman who killed everyone Ellie loved,

flowers that grew through the cracks in the pavement. He had been 
walking for 5 hours now, and his pack was starting to feel heavier and

he saw some shops on the main strip of road. He spotted a general store 
just 30 yards off, and decided he'd check there first. Maybe it hadn't 
been completely cleaned out from other looters, and just maybe there was
 some food or supplies. He seemed to be care free, not quite walking as

 had left the group of people they'd met and stumbled their way into the
 woods outside of the cityscape. They needed to make camp for the night 
somewhere because if the rain was to get any heavier, they were screwed.
 Gwen looked around them for a moment and saw that in the woods, it was a
 much darker environment due to the lush undergrowth. It would be hard 
to spot a walker through it if they weren't paying attention. A breeze 
blew through Gwen's hair and they had a feeling that the rain was most 
likely going to become a storm at some point in the future. Not a good 
thing. Their socks were beginning to get dirty and wet. Gwen was 
seriously starting to regret throwing their shoes away — but then again,
 it was their shoes or their life.</p><p class="center italic">Gwen's 
eyes were still red and puffy from the crying they did in the back of 
the truck. They were more anxious about a run in with a walker than they
 ever were before. If the Clicker wasn't enough to scare them, that 
horde sure was. Thinking about the Clicker made Gwen check their arms 
for the bruises and cuts that had been caused by them flying across the 
roof. If they were able to find a place to settle for a while, they 
could clean them off. Gwen continued their slow walk through the woods

words like that meant nothing to her. She knew that she and Mika could

distance just to be sure.</p><p class="center italic"> Sam didn’t speak 
yet, just showed herself and watched Jaxson carefully. “Everyone here is
 dead, even the ones that have came back.” That was mostly true, the 
only other living person she knew of that was here, was Mika. And Sam 
still felt the need to protect him until she felt like she could talk a 
little more. Watching this person with lightly narrowed eyes, she stood 
her ground in the same place. Mostly just confused as to why this Priest
 would be giving out food in the first place. Everyone would need food, 
but why not keep it for yourself?</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message info-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="linkblue">

 Lost in the forest. Rather predictable, at least for someone like 
Casey. They just tended to wonder about, not thinking all too much about
 destination, which was often how they got watched. They pulled out the 
map that was pulled out of their bag fluently, their big brown eyes 
scanning over it. “Hm, I must be somewhere around here.” They pointed 
around at the location they could only assume was where their current 
station was. “Well I must be lost…” Casey would continue to stride 
through the forest, in their hand was what they seemed to use to protect
 themselves most of the time, a staff. It was long and had a rather 
beaten handle. But it worked like a charm. Casey would glance over, 
seeing a cabin in the distance. It seemed unlucky that it didn’t have a 
resident in it, whether it was ‘borrowed’ from someone else was able to 
be answered at that time. “Hello? Is everyone out here?” They would ask,
 glancing around the place. Leave would crunch under their feet as they 
continued to walk through the woods.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/60ab8315b4e2684a6168ac99a59dca29d817ca9br1-1799-1292v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 Presley walked through the alleys of the store, a pharmacy. The last 
couple places had been a bust, bare shelves, nothing but dust. But this 
one seemed more promising, not much canned food but that was usually 
rotten anyway, there was no use in gaining an illness. Her hand would 
slowly reach over to the box of bandaids, before slipping into a little 
duffle bag over her shoulder. Even most of the medicine was bad at that 
point, but it was always good to have. But the best find was seeds, 
flowers, of course, but most vegetables and fruit. Better food, a more 
effective food source. Presley didn’t really like people, it wasn’t 
worth getting close, being close with people just got you hurt, in more 
ways than one.</p><p class="center italic">Presley was dressed in a pair
 of rather worn out jeans, an old band shirt. It was beaten in and full 
of holes at that point. She wore combat boots, with tightly tied shoe 
laces. Fingerless gloves covered her hands, as she fiddled with a bag of
 cough drops. A gun at her lip, and a bat sticking out of her bag, a 
worn out handle on it. Her blonde hair hanging over her face in a messy 
way, nearly covering her blue eye. Her face was cover with dirt, smudged

looted, drawers were nearly open, and only a few cans of beans. Better 
than nothing at least.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/791bd1e01c52e97716ee539f6187a0b020b5700br1-580-374v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 jumped at the sudden appearance of a voice. They turned towards it, the
 metla pole thay hadn't let go of since the Clicker incident was raised.
 They looked the person who spoke up and down. A man that looked a lot 
more prepared than they will ever be. "I guess so..." they muttered, 
putting down their weapon but still staying on guard. The woods was a 
difficult place to escape from so if this man decided to attack them, 
they'd have to make a run for it. Gwen could already tell they were weak
 without their dad and Isabella here. "Isn't it a bit dangerous to 
confront strangers in the woods?" They tilted their head to mirror the 
stranger's question.</p><p class="center italic">Gwen scrunched up their
 toes a bit from nerves but remembered no shoes meant more dirt on their

Their eyes would scan over their living over the male’s living

to take your food.” Casey would say simply enough, gaining a smile from 
ear to ear as they walked towards the door heading inside of the little

 wind blew cold on this silent night, with only the soft rustle of

into the center of the creature’s chest. She had thrown it while the 
creature had been airborne, the sound of the creature’s clicks guiding 
her aim.</p><p>Breathing heavily, the girl glares at the corpse laying 
where she once stood, hands shaking from adrenaline. Out of the corner 
of her eye a single light flickers in the distance, coming from a shack 
not too far away. Shoving a stray strand of black hair away from her 
dirt-caked face, the girl turns towards it, her blue eyes narrowed in 
speculation.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="timestamp">

 The small male had his katana in hand, as he quitely walked down a 
road, watching his feet, but he was listening to wear he was. He didn't 
want to be attack by zombies, or people that wanted what little supplies
 he had. But as he walked, his feet seemed to barley hit the ground, 
since they were so quite, as he walk towards a gas station. He was being
 dead silent, almost dead like, probably not the best idea, but that's 
okay, he was gonna be fine. He walked in and softly closed the doors 
behind him, so that nothing would get attracted to the building. He 
searched the place, for zombies, and people, he knew it probably wasn't 
the best idea, but it was okay. When finding pretty much nothing, other 
than the body of a person who must have worked there in the past. So he 
just made sure to lock the door of the closet which the body was in, 
just in case, he didn't want anything to happen, or to be attacked. he 
realxed, and sighed as he leaned against the counter, taking a minute or
 two, before he started looking for any food. he was quite hungry, and 
hadn't seen anyone for months, so he was also lonely. But he didn't 
mind, he was afraid if someone got to attached, or close to him they'd 
die, or get bit, like he had been once. He looked at the stump of his 
arm, that was still wrapped in bandages. It hadn't been that long ago. 
But as he thought about his arm, and how he hadn't seen people, he 
bumped into a shelf, which had a can of BEANS. He smiled and grabbed it,
 before walking over to the cash register. He looked around and saw a 
lighter, he lit it up, and moved it under the can. So it could Cook, he 
was starving, so he would eat the BEANS, even if he didn't like them. He
 was just hungry, so this was close enough. He just waited, hoping 
nothing and no one tried to walk in and steal it, while he cooked the 
can of BEANS</p><p class="bolder center">┗━━━━━━━┛</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/3f43bb9b6414bfbd48e5620a906270350cdd35e5r1-736-736v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 air in front of her formed into condensed droplets as the heat of her 
breath hit the chill of the night, though it was difficult to tell 
through the suffocating darkness. It closed in on her from all sides, 
shutting out the light of the half moon that hung in the sky. Stepping 
carefully over the broken twigs that lay strewn on the forest floor, the
 girl’s blue eyes scan the surrounding scenery carefully, clutching a 
rather dull butch knife in her hand.</p><p>It had been several days 
since she had last seen one of the undead, but this was an area of the 
forest that she had never been in before and it made her wary. Clenching
 her jaw tightly, the tall girl presses forward, a large canvas bag 
attached to her back.</p><p>Suddenly, there appears to be a break in the
 trees, soft moonlight passing through the dark shadows of the midnight 
wood. The girl’s pupils dilate instinctively, the breath catching in her
 throat. Quickening her pace, the tall girl readjusts the heavy load on 
her back before pushing a strand of hair out of her face, her heart 
racing in her chest. It had been a while since she had been able to step
 out of the woods, seen a clear sky. The thought of being free from the 
trees was almost euphoric, the thought of being able to see the moon-</p><p>Suddenly,
 the inhuman sound of a clicker enters her ears and the girl stops in 
her tracks, raising the knife in her hand to meet the creature. It was 
slow but calculative, carefully approaching the spot where she stood, 
its eyes blacker than the night swallowing it. Clenching her jaw tight, 
Fiona feels her legs tense in preparation to leap, her hand shaking in 
ill-concealed exhaustion.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message info-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="linkblue">

stayed quiet as she watched his movements. Making sure she could hear if
 someone or something was coming up from behind her. Over the past few 
years, almost every trick in the book of an apocalypse had been played 
on her. In this case, it would be distracted from the front and attacked
 from the behind. She took a step back so she could quickly pivot her 
body if she had to run. But this man in front of her seemed genuine, 
like he meant no harm towards her at all. Slowly, she was starting to 
believe it.</p><p class="center italic"> Sam nodded when he stated what 
he would be reaching for, and her shoulders became less tense. Watching 
him place the water and saltines onto the table, she lightly nodded. 
Water for both her and Mika. And they could share the saltines if he 
wanted any. “Why aren’t you keeping it for yourself?” She was still 
confused by that. Samara understood he was a Priest and everything, but 
he could have kept all of that and had extra supplies for himself if 
things got rough. She held her bat in one hand now, moving her standing 
position more to the right. She didn’t want to stand in the same spot 
for very much longer. It could be dangerous.</p><p class="center italic">
 “I’m separated from my ally right now.” She didn’t give much more 
information about it, because she still did want to protect Mika. Even 
though Sam was sure Jaxson wouldn’t cause any harm unless she were to 
attack him.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><!----><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/1f6df9d1c64817587a9fc9dd0415325a4047fa27r1-750-750v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

interesting word to use, it might just make things easier. Though he'll 
have to be careful how he used it since it seemed to really affect the

word, that was until he remembered his adoptive father had always used 
that word when referring to him and his other two siblings. "Ah crap,

hear anything outside whatever it was she was experiencing in her head.</p><p class="center italic">He

 seeing this mess that Ellie was; reminded him of his sister. Would she 
be like this if he died along with his father and brother? He couldn't 
imagine it. The girl was always an optimistic one but the thought 
managed to intrude his mind, and although only a little bit. It managed 
to chip away at his resolve and he hadn't even managed to find her in 
the apocalypse.</p><p class="center">"Ezra, what're we going do about the blubbering mess?"

 Mikaela's  eyes wandered away as a momentary friend completely  left 
him yet wished him well on his jounery. It left a cold spot in his heart
 where his hand lightly  held his chest and shifted off to begin  
walking  through  the carnival  with the rain picking up, he didn't  
know what to do except hide in a booth til it would cease to continue, 
holding his gun tightly as he sat down on a table under a tarp. He was 
freighted by thunder so he was anxious  pondering the thought  of 
lightening  striking near by. His hands practically trembled even before

 click of combat boots could be heard on the Ceramic tiles that cover 
the Gas Station’s bathroom, a man wearing worn tactical gear was seen, a
 faded patch of what looked like NYPD back before this whole world 
ending dilemma. The gear was clearly worn, his shirt was a navy blue 
Under Armor shirt, his jacket wrapped around his waist as he was hot. 
His plate carrier resting on his chest had clear patches of tape and 
fabric where he’s been shot, with the steel plates within the carrier 
still holding strong. His helmet was strapped to his belt, as a 
ballistic helmet tends to become heavy after wearing it for so long, 
replaced by a leather hat that had its right side sown up. His vest held
 an assortment of rifle magazines, seemingly belonging to the rifle on 
his back. It was a M4A1, standard issue carbine given to SWAT Members, 
having burst and semiautomatic fire options. On his hip sat his 
preferred service pistol; an M1911A1, being his personal pistol he 
owned. On his vest sat a cross draw holster, holding a more powerful 
handgun, a .357 magnum he had looted off a Sheriff’s body during his 
wandering and attached to to his vest. He had 6 rounds in his magnum, 2 
magazines of .45 and 3 magazines of 5.56 that he had sparingly used, 
finding ammo whenever he could. The Medkit on his vest held some items; 
gauze, trauma shears, ketamine, and an assortment of other tactical 
medical pieces.</p><p class="center italic">He would finish washing his 
hand, then cleaning the blade of the small hatchet he kept on his belt, 
it being covered in whatever spore shit was within those zombie 
creatures. He used his hatchet most often, it being the easiest and 
least costly weapon he had, but it was small and harder to deal with the
 more dangerous creatures. He would leave the bathroom and hooking his 
hatchet to his belt.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message from-me"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/1e56d3cef4a4e6a52303bffe4865a7163cab8169r1-1877-2048v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><!----> <div class="message-content"><div class="text-msg rich-content"><p class="center">(¯`*•.¸,¤°´✿.｡.:**.:｡.✿`°¤,¸.•*´¯)</p><p class="bolder center">꧁ᴛʜᴇ ᴍᴀᴄʜɪɴɪɴɢ ᴀᴄᴇ꧂</p><p class="center underline italic">Eianna Laevateinn</p><p class="center italic">@Apartments</p><p class="bolder center italic">Maxis</p><p class="center">(¯`*•.¸,¤°´✿.｡.:**.:｡.✿`°¤,¸.•*´¯)</p><p class="center">The

 Holding onto the small hand of his daughter, Macsen pulled her close to
 his leg and let the little lady clasp her small hands around being 
pulled along when Macsen took a step forward. Clídna, the bright little 
sun Macsen called his Princess, positioned her small feet on her 
father's shoes while holding onto his black pants. Mostly being covered 
by his long black cloak Clídna couldn't be seen unless one tried looking
 at the open part of his cloak or his feet where small dirty shoes could
 be seen. The two were located inside a slightly collapsed 3 story 
building, the floor above had fallen years ago leaving the rooftop 
lopsided but still intact enough to shelter someone inside. Macsen was 
stepping carefully across the crumbled debris, moving to the other side 
of the building he couldn't hear anything but keep what seemed to be a 
spear in hand.</p><p class="center italic"> A considerably strange 
weapon to hold onto but Macsen used it as if it was another limb on his 
body, careful not to hurt his daughter the skull masked man made it to 
the other side of the building without a problem but stopped when he 
felt his daughter squeeze her small arms around his legs tighter. 
Looking down Macsen used the back of the spear to separate his long 
jacket to look at his small daughter who also looked up at him, giving a
 goofy smile to her father Clídna earned a small chuckle in response 
before he bent slightly and picked her up easily. Carrying the small 
girl in his arms while still holding the spear, they had yet to run into
 anything deadly or even remotely dangerous but that was mostly due to 
luck.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/dd8550b8984eeb19ec8a146d106388c97f331c1ar1-1200-1561v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 Slowly and carefully moving from the deserted building Macsen walked 
out before setting his daughter back down, lowering his large body 
Macsen pulled off his skull mask revealing a handsome yet tired looking 
face. Moving a finger to his lips Macsen pulled up his hood covering his
 long messy black hair, placing the skull mask over his face Macsen 
stood back up but stumbled slightly. 37 years old, he could already feel
 his body wanting to rest but instead he pushed forward letting his 
daughter latch her small arms around his leg again. Looking to the sun 
peaking through grey clouds as it drizzled down rain, Macsen knew he 
would need to find a safe place for him and his daughter before 
nightfall came. The backpack he carried held enough food and water to 
keep them going for a few days but would undoubtedly need to be 
restocked soon.</p><p class="center italic"> Walking with a slight limp 
due to his daughter, the two stayed very quiet as Macsen located a 
slightly steady looking building to camp in for the night. Moving slowly
 and quietly, Clídna wrapped her arms tighter when her father lifted his
 leg high to step up onto an elevated debris. Doing her best to not make
 a sound Macsen moved his hand slightly and gently gave a pat to her 
daughter’s head which seemed fairly awkward on the outside. Finally 
arriving at the destination Macsen chose, he waited for some time before
 moving inside hearing nothing, the building had at most 4 stories to it
 and seemed to be a slightly crumbled hotel. The open entrance was empty
 of any life which made Macsen tense, walking to the stairwell he opened
 the door very slowly but shut it quickly and quietly when he heard the 
sound of clicking.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/dd8550b8984eeb19ec8a146d106388c97f331c1ar1-1200-1561v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 Pulling his daughter up and into his arms Macsen didn't hesitate to 
move out of the building quickly, he didn't have the proper strength to 
deal with a clicker and sure as hell didn't wish to risk his daughter's 
life or well being just to get up some stairs that would probably have 
even more undead. Moving from the hotel Macsen could only settle for a 
broken and vine covered building, walking inside Macsen found the roof 
open like the few buildings before letting rain drizzle inside. Walking 
around to a slightly covered area Macsen made a small hidden ‘tent’ and 
placed his daughter down as well as his backpack and spear, 
straightening himself he went to look around finding nothing but empty 
and ransacked shelves it seemed he had entered a very small convenience 
store. Taking up a few things on the floor he walked back to his 
daughter and saw her eating what seemed to be an energy bar, taking 
small sips of water. Clídna watched her father approach before extending
 the other half of the energy bar out to him.</p><p class="center italic">
 Smiling, Macsen removed his mask letting his slightly wrinkled face 
come into view yet there was still undoubtedly some handsomeness. Even 
though Macsen was 37 he had developed slight wrinkles under his eyes 
giving him an older look, these wrinkles came from the stress of living 
in constant danger, his daughter on the other hand seemed healthy and 
bursting with energy though a little on the thin side. Settling down 
Macsen pulled down his hood before crawling under the hidden ‘tent’, 
taking the half eaten bar from Clídna the small girl quickly climbed on 
her father's lap and closed her eyes finding him a little wet from the 
rain but warm enough to at least rest her eyes for a while. Unbuckling 
his long black jacket, Macsen opened it to reveal a dry black long 
sleeve shirt underneath, Clídna opened her eyes and quickly made herself
 comfortable inside the jacket of her father who was still munching 
slowly on the energy bar.</p><p class="center">┕━»•»☀️«•«━━━━━━━━┙</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/e93c24d81919889f59547bf25c3ff3762de8e65fr1-1536-2048v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

emotions. Soon, she did. She stopped crying and the pain in the chest 
faded away to a gentle ache. She could still hear Joel’s voice float 
around in her head, though.</p><p class="center"> But, she was fuelled 
with emotion again at Ryuto’s whisper to Ezra. She sat up, a fiery rage 
burning in her eyes, and she hissed, “I can hear you! And here’s what 
I’m going to do: I’m going after Abby.” She sensed that they would 
protest again and so she shook her head, “You can’t stop this.”</p><p class="center">
 She took out her revolver and checked her bullets. She continued 
speaking as she did the same with all of her firearms, “And you can come
 with me if you like, since you seem to care about me for some reason. 
Even if you don’t come along, I’m going.”</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/52f51955a6b0a1c57624ff0983f06cda1a2f1ac0r1-828-827v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 Quinn looked up at her and nodded, then thought about it, and shrugged.
 “He... kinda?” She paused. “It’s a long story but basically we were on a
 supply trip a couple years ago when we were jumped. One of the guys 
knocked him out cold and he was bleeding everywhere. They didn’t kill 
me, they were trying to kidnap me i think, but that was a big mistake. I
 killed them with a crowbar and i took my dad back home. He still was 
breathing so i just put him on his bed. Then a couple weeks ago i heard 
glass break and ran to his room. An infected must’ve smelled him because
 it broke his window and began chewing on him.” She grabbed a water 
bottle and sipped it before she continued. “It got a quick crowbar to 
the brain and i tossed it back out the window. I didn’t know what to do 
so i chained him up and barricaded the window. He’s been like this for 
about a week now, but I’m keeping him alive incase a cure comes along” 
she told Marina. “And if i let him go, someone else will kill him” she 
added.</p><p class="center"> Quinn continued to write in her journal. 
“Anyways enough about that. You said your husband makes you wear that 
dress? Why don’t you just leave him? It’s not like you need to go to

 Open his mouth Mika gave a sharp yawn and fanned  his hand over his 
mouth, his pearly white teeth shinning devilishly after he stopped his 
unnecessary growling at the man. The proper introduction  was enough to 
ease the tenison of his muscles  and muddled  his one track mind to 
focus on  guiding hands around the rumble. He wasn't  hungry since he 
had tea and muffled down on 3 bags of chips today however, his hand  
swiftly  took the crakers and bottle  of water to hurdle it away in his 
bag. he pocessed enough  food to last him 2 weeks  alone due to hoarding
  everything  he found including many can foods. He stashed alot in the 
woods up ahead in small crates hidden in the vegetation. He nodded 
quietly  before  inching closer to get a look at the priest's book. 
"You're  not here for Sam's  ass right? her butt already belongs  to me,
 i found it first." exclaiming  he pushed a hand to his chest with a 
proud  look as he nodded his head  up in a cocky fashion before someone 
had screamed his name out in the distance, beckoning his attention. He 
knew the voice taking a moment to steal to bible from  the priests  
hands before he scurried off to greet Harris immediately.</p><p class="center">"Tea
 boy"  yelping he stumbled out from behind the booth in which sam and 
the priest were to throw his arms over Harris shoulders. The man reeked 
of soot so, it concerned mika while Mika was soaked by the rain like a 
wet dog. "Ah, are you in danger. your knight shall save you." remarking 
he  shuffled a hand in his bag while the other held the bible he stole 
from the priest. His gun now strapped across his back so he wouldn't  
get distracted  and leave it behind. "Look its jesus"</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/bd0682bce31c0b94c43e11cffc93d7bbbd7a0b17r1-408-366v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 listened to Quinn's story, putting a hand on her shoulder gently in a 
comforting way, the poor girl was born into this situation and she didnt
 deserve the way the world was now. Marina was lucky to have had at 
least two years of normalcy before the new normal. "I'm so sorry to hear
 that. You're probably right, I just worry he may be in pain. He doesn't
 deserve to suffer".</p><p>When asked about her husband, she sighed. "He
 found me when I was just ten years old. My parents had just been 
infected and he came striding out of the forest with his pistol and shot
 them. He practically raised me after that point, raised me to be his 
wife, that sort of situation is hard to leave when it is all you know 
and when your abuser makes sure you only rely on them. I only realised 
when he killed our son what was going on. It was just a matter of 
waiting for him to be eventually infected and then I put a bullet 
between his eyes. That was a few weeks ago. I've been travelling ever 
since so, I guess I did leave him" she spoke softly.</p><p>Once she was 
finished she smiled brightly. "Whoa, that was nice to get off of my 
chest. I haven't had much communication with anyone but my husband for 
so long, I didnt have anyone to speak to". She looked to Quinn with a 
smile, just glad to have another company.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/1fb53a2f83beb5d3764e4aa292cb890019f5fb42r1-750-1000v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 Shifting back to Harris he gave a gimme hands, beckoning them to hold

 began to walk down the road to the march of their own drum. "Hobbies? I
 guess playing the piano counts" they smiled at the mention of their 
beloved instrument. It wasnonly now they were stsrting to miss the janky
 piano back at the deserted mall. It was nice to play a little tune on 
it everyday until that Clicker showed up and ruined everything. Now Gwen
 had no piano, (comically) no shoes and barely any energy left to 
continue fighting. "What about you?" They looked to Vincent as they 
walked. If they were going to be teaming up for a while, they hoped to 
get to know a bit about their partner. Gwen took a guess and thought 
that Vincent probably had a life before the infections began. They 
thought it was a bit rude to guess someone's age but as long as they 
didn't say it out loud, Vincent didn't need to know that Gwen thought he

 sky  was growing  dim, the golden ball of radiating light tucking  down
 slowly  into its sunset. It was nice, enjoyable  even, shifting his 
head around watching the conversation  he was growing dazzed, tired 
even. His body  felt cold as ice with the breeze coursing through 
against his wet skin, sneezing interrupting the conversation  as he grew
 an anxious  look even glancing away to avoid eye contact. He was 
extremely  sensitive  to the weather fluctuation. As he sat along the 
dirty brick floor he  was fuzzed by the sharp pain  coming from his 
head. The migrant  was growing  to the point he was unresponsive  for 
quite abit, getting off the flithy  ground he took the medicine given to
 him by sam. He wasn't  even a child, pretty much a grown adult, 
reaching his hands around he felt a warm blanket dropped over his 
shoulders, it was from sam. It made him feel comfortable "We're  going 
to have to share beds because the other hotel rooms haven't  been 
searched and its late. I locked the leading bedroom rooms so that we 
wouldn't  have the zombie problem. The fridges in a majority  of the 
rooms are packed so if we gather all day tomorrow  we can all find a 
place to  settle permanently." his one track thoughts allowing him to 
process all his plans fast and quick. He was aware of how hotels worked 
and sizing up the hotel there was enough  drinks and snacks to last them
 3 months since it was a 40 floor complex and 20 rooms or more a floor. 
As he fixed a hand through his messy hair, his steps grew softer, 
holding the blanket  around hismelf when traveling up close to  Sam's  
hip. He had gathered loads of stuff from the booths and some meanless 
junk  so the bag he stole was packed. "i want to eat meat tonight  but 
we didn't  get the chance to hunt" whining out he shut his eyes 
momentarily  with a groan, rubbing his fingers against his temples.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/1b5835525d922774da3329689e625cb276b997b1r1-736-736v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 moment they noticed Vincent was on high alert, Gwen slowed their 
childish swinging walk to more of a shuffle. They kept close to the man 
but not too close so it invaded his personal space. The gap between them
 left enough room so Gwen could swing the metal pole they still clutched
 onto without hitting him. "Do you think this place might be safe 
inside?" They lowered their voice just above a whisper. If anything were
 to hear them then they'd be able to know where it was heading in from. 
Gwen knew that Vincent was more experienced in combat just by looking at
 him so they trusted him to know when something was coming. Walkers were
 always troublesome in the cities because they tended to travel in 
hordes like back at the market for example. In the dark it was even 
worse because you could only see their eyes and nothing else. The 
haunting glow of orange was something Gwen would hste to wake up to in

wondered if he will just finish this guy off quickly, steal his shit if 
he even has anything, and slit his neck than leave. He grabbed his gun

he held onto his knife. "Just incase if anything unwanted comes trotting
 at us." He said with a smile as he eyes the other. "Also whats your

 He mumbled and began to cross the road. Hopefully this gas station had a
 map, he knew some sold them way back when so he'd hope that was the 
case now. Even if it did sell before, he hoped it were still there. Or 
at least a few of the maps.</p><p class="center">As approaching the gas

 on the glass. We will need to block the door once we clear the place." 
He said slowly. "I'll check the backrooms, you look for objects to block
 the door with." He gave the command and walked more into the store. 
He'd have to check all he could just to make sure they were safe for the

 Fleur also didn’t believe in heaven or hell, but there had to be a 
place where people could rest easy after death. She began to think of 
the stories her mother told her about, a world where all souls and 
sprits go over time. Hoping it was a good place for Daniel’s sister and 
her mother.</p><p class="center italic"> “Alright.” She nodded when he 
said she could call him whatever. Standing up with him, she produced a 
flashlight of her own from her bag. Walking off in the way she was 
directed to make sure nothing was nearby to come and try and eat them. 
Walking all around the far perimeter, she did two checks of it. On her 
second one, she found a zombie.</p><p class="center italic"> It’s body 
had been sliced up and it could barely move. It had crawled away from 
something, possibly a bear by the marks it had. The head slowly moving 
its jaws as it tried to bite at her. She bent down a bit away from it 
with a frown, looking at the poor person that had to go through that. 
She pulled out her knife and quickly stabbed it into the head so it 
would soon die out. With a sigh, she stood up and returned her knife to 
her hip. Returning back towards the dying fire and the tent.</p><p class="center"> ~❊~</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/6bbb8b5c9fb1b36d91523a6093d77b036eabdc7cr1-570-793v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 Fleur was waiting for Danny to come back to the tent, crouched down by 
the dying fire again. Hoping the rain would stop soon, even though there
 wasn’t very much. She calmly watched the embers of the fire slowly cool
 in the rain and die with the rest of the once roaring flames.</p><p class="center italic">
 The blonde’s head quickly lifted. Hearing some yelling a little ways 
from the tent, she sprinted through the forest floor towards what she 
hoped to be an uninjured friend. She stopped a few feet behind him, 
bright blue eyes watching a man with a trolley behind him and a woman 
with a dog at her side. She hoped nobody would start a fight, that 
solved nothing but bringing more of the “re-living” towards them.</p><p class="center italic">
 She stayed quiet at first, unsure of what had gone down and didn’t want
 to make it worse. Fleur reached forward and gently placed a hand onto 
Daniel’s arm, lowering it down from aiming at the man in front of them. 
“Yelling at someone now will not solve anything. We should not threaten 
those who are still alive, we are not the monsters.”</p><p class="center italic">
 Turning back towards the the duo in front of them, keeping her hand on 
Daniel’s arm to make sure he didn’t shoot anyone with the arrows. She 
spoke up towards Blaise and Maddison. “You’re passing through the 
forest, yes?” Fleur at least wanted to know their intentions before 
anyone started a fight or loud argument over possibly nothing important.</p><p class="center"> ~❊~</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/60471444550bd56c75b30e26d1cf8ac8e947c350r1-1440-1486v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 Fleur stood at Daniel’s side, even though he nudged her off of him. She
 was just trying to prevent anyone from getting hurt. Listening to both 
of them, she stepped to the side with her friend and let them pass

probably wasn’t the best thing to do through the tension. And the male 
needed to get the bed back to his people.</p><p class="center italic"> 
“I have.” She answered for herself, being from pretty much everywhere.

She couldn’t say anything for Danny, though, she barely knew him. 
Hopefully, they could eventually get to know eachother. As long as 
nothing went bad now.</p><p class="center italic"> “For now we’re

 When Daniel tilted his head back, telling her to go back to the fire 
and check on it. She hesitantly agreed, taking another glance at the 
others before she started to talk off. But stopped then they talked 
about staying the night at the tent. Listening to what the male with the
 trolley had to say, she nodded. “As for your wound, I can take a look 
at it. When you make it to the tent, I’ll treat it for you.” She nodded 
and walked off towards the fire. Hoping she could keep it going just a 
little bit longer since they would probably be up later than expected.</p><p class="center italic">
 Poking the stick at the logs so the fire would reappear just a little 
bit. Making sure it didn’t grow too much so it wouldn’t attract any of 
the walkers. Now that that was done, she sat back and crossed her legs. 
Finding a paste in a jar and many different herbal and first aid 
medicines to use for really any type of wound. Her mother also taught 
her everything about medicines and healing, so hopefully it would be 
enough knowledge to help out with whatever it was. All she had to do now
 was wait.</p><p class="center"> ~❊~</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/6bbb8b5c9fb1b36d91523a6093d77b036eabdc7cr1-570-793v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 Mikas eyes dulled as he stared down at the marble counter, his fingers 
 sliding against the smooth surface before his attention  was drawn to 
Sam laying the blanket  down on his shoulders as he was trying to prep 
the food.The care she had for him gave a small sense of being wanted. 
She wouldn't  even let him get ill on her watch, it made his heart feel 
fuzzy, giving up on making the food, swiftly  turning his head with a 
gleeful smile. "Thank you sam" acknowledging her help, backing off from 
the counter while now heading  over to sit beside  jaxson on the carpet 
flooring. He was curious  and willing to learn however, he did have a 
hatred for the fact jesus touched blind people. "can we start from the 
beginning?" glancing up at jaxson he spoke genuinely  dropping his hand 
to pick at the carpet with the blanket weighing down on his back.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/52f51955a6b0a1c57624ff0983f06cda1a2f1ac0r1-828-827v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

smiled to him and nodded, ruffling out his hair gently. “Of course. 
Don’t get sick on me now.” She stood up and began to finish heating up 
the last plate. Once it was done, she left her own on the counter. 
Bringing the two plates over to the male’s on the floor. She set the 
plates onto the table beside them. Then listened to what Jaxson had to 
say to her about the shower. “Alright, thank you, but you should get one
 after. You two eat up.”</p><p class="center italic"> Turning back, she 
pulled down her hair and walked into the bathroom. Starting the shower, 
she waited for a moment to try and get the cold water to at least heat 
up a tad bit. But she gave up on it and got into the shower, being 
relatively quick since she wasn’t all too dirty and it was pretty cold.</p><p class="center italic">
 Once she was done, she took advantage of the clean and dry towels. 
Drying off and getting redressed, she walked out of the bathroom. 
Snatching the second extra blanket from the closet, she crossed the room
 and settled down on the other side of Jaxson. Leaning into the wall 
with her whole body wrapped in a blanket with just her head poking out, 
she looked down at the bible. Interested in the story Jaxson might tell.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/f4457f77ff5d50636fc0f60f1608a1c26e1bbde1r1-320-320v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 Fleur looked up when she was thanked by someone. “Oh, of course.” She 
nodded and added in her own smile to him. Reaching into her bag, she 
handed him a cloth, a little bit of blood stained onto it. “I would wipe
 that blood off of your hands, it can infect your body if ingested.” She
 pointed to the bloody arrow and his hand from when he stabbed the arrow
 into a walkers head. Then she sat back and snacked on another few 
berries.</p><p class="center italic"> Turning to Maddison, she offered 
her some of her berries and bread. Pulling out a few wild strawberries, 
she held them in her hand out toward Ryker gently. Knowing she couldn’t 
give him too much or else it might make the dog sick. But just this 
amount would be fine for him, and give him plenty of nutrients with the 
dog food his owner gave him.</p><p class="center italic"> She looked up 
at Blaise and raised a blonde brow. “If you think it’ll be okay. But I 
really don’t mind treating whatever it is. You shouldn’t be traveling 
with an injury.” Fleur nodded up at him, but wouldn’t push it. She fixed
 the large wool poncho around her body and leaned back into the large 
log behind her. Glancing around from time to time, but for now she kind 
of just kept to herself.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><!----><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/f4457f77ff5d50636fc0f60f1608a1c26e1bbde1r1-320-320v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 he could stop to rest. He took off his backpack and his cloak. Man, did
 it feel good to get that backpack off. He took the wrapped package from
 his messenger bag and set it down, as well as the bike gear next to it.
 He'd seen it on his way out. Toby sat back on his hands to a moment, 
looking at the cloudy sky. He was still alive. Now, to get to work. He 
opened the package and looked at the organs that lay in front of him, an
 infected heart and a liver, both covered in blood. He withdrew a knife 
from his pocket and flicked it open.</p><p>"Eugh." he frowned as he 
sliced open the heart over top of his cloak, and blood spilled out over 
it. He then used the heart to spread the blood around the fur that made 
up the exterior. It was disgusting, but necessary. Part of being a 
wanderer was doing whatever would help you to survive. Next was the 
liver. He didn't cut this open. There wasn't much blood. He simply 
rubbed it around on the cloak, wiping off the blood and the smell of 
rotten juices as well. Then he cast them both aside. His hands were now 
covered in blood, and he had a freshly camouflaged cloak. He then looked

 would be walking down a street in the suburban outline of the city, 
eating a perfectly preserved Twinkie. He wore his usual gear; jacket 
around his waist, plate carrier on, aviators and leather hat resting on 
his head. The older man would wipe away the crumbs left behind in his 
beard, which wasn’t large but still enough to catch food; he hasn’t 
found a half decent razor anywhere so far. He would continue his walk 
until he reached a 4 way stop light to see something leaned over in an 
alleyway, pulling his hatchet in case and approached it. As he got 
closer, he would smell the stench of rotting meat, wrinkling his nose as
 he held the Twinkie in his mouth. “Son, has your parents ever told you 
not to play with your food?” He asked when the man stood up after he 
seemed finished of wiping his clothing in guts. Rex placed his hatchet 
in his belt, crossing his arms a bit as he looked at him. Rex saw he was
 a tall yet thin man, Rex being shorter than him but heavier in 
comparison. “Don’t mind me asking, but what is with the blood and guts 
over the clothes? You some sort of raider trying to look cool or is that
 just ‘the new thing’ these days.” Rex said sarcastically.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/14911473422bd0004d6c67328407b7f774fa9078r1-1536-2048v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

tilting its head and letting out one of those horrible croaking noises.

by his side contained all the info he had collected from personally 
killing and seeing others killing these foul creatures. They’re fast,

 nodded "yeah," he said happily. He pushed the cart to the tunnel, it 
was kinda hard to push. "Okie dokie" he said, he started pushing the 
cart down the tunnel. "Do you have any fears?" He asked out of no where,
 when he asked this they were still just walking through the tunnel, he 
was probably just trying to get to know the other more or pass the time.
  The cart then got stuck. "Huh-" yurie said, he tilted his head and

 listened the whole time, looked at him, seeming insterested in what he 
was saying. He was very respectful. "7 years? Youve had That freaky 
dream for 7 years??" He said, he felt bad for the other. Yurie wasnt 
afraid of the ocean, but that still freaked him out. Mostly the fish 
with teeth and the big hole for face man. The drowning just somehow 
didnt make him worried or scared. Almost like he would just. Except it. 
He couldnt imagine having that dream for 7 years though.  "That does 
sound like a nightmare" he said. He kept pushing the cart, it wasat the 
darkest part of the tunnel now. "Being trapped in places that I cant get
 out of freak me out, and I hate being alone, but for some reason that 
one only makes scared after I get close to people.- like I was perfectly
 fine in the dumpster-" he said. "I use to get locked in my room a lot 
when I was a kid.. Like days a lot.. And it got pretty lonely and Igot 
pretty.." he looked at the ground and rubbed the back of his neck. He 
was going to say hungry but he shook his head. Though he did get hungry.
 "Boring and sad-" he said.

 faint music of an old, slightly cracked radio echoed softly over the 
water as the houseboat drifted over the water without making a noise 
otherwise.</p><p>It was late already, all sunlight had gone from the sky
 and the faint beat of 'Safe and sound' caused the deck to vibrate 
gently. Everything was glittering wet from the lithe rain but Leander 
was not bothered by it since the weather was so warm. The air was thick 
to breathe in and he could feel that he was sweating despite the small 
raindrops that tickled against his forehead.</p><p>The young man sat on 
the front railing beneath the steering wheel which he had tied to the 
board of the little captains hut so the boat would simply follow the 
stream that was going relatively straight without needing to correct the
 course.</p><p>It was incredibly peaceful in a way, none of the undead 
could get to them over here, and it had a sense of normality, not 
needing to fear anything aside from other, thinking humans.</p><p>Many 
had tried to steal the boat from him in the past, tried to convince him 
to let them on just to take advantage of his kindness. So far none of 
them had actually gotten away with it.</p><p>Taking another drag of his 
joint, Leander turned around where he was sitting on the thin metal 
ledge, looking over his shoulder and down into the living area where Kyo
 was sleeping peacefully. At least for now. He had gathered by now that 
like most of them she too had nightmares. Honestly it was almost a 
normal occurrence by now. How could it not be if your whole life is a 
nightmare in itself. They had both been born into the apocalypse.. you'd
 think they would get used to it.</p><p>...continued</p><p class="center">╰─....🌿.──────────╯</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/2c11c208a784c4074d19c7b5789af83ccf78f2a3r1-512-512v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 what i was saying is that ive had a reoccurring nightmare about the 
ocean." He continued after the brief interuption. He told yurie his 
nightmare "well the nightmare goes like this. Im sitting in a dark room,
 and theres an aquarium in front of me. That aquarium is the only thing 
lighting the room up, and inside it theres a fish with human teeth. It'd
 talk to me in a super deep voice, and i always get freaked out when he 
talked." He paused.</p><p class="center">After a brief stop, he 
continued "Then all of a sudden im underwater, in the middle of the 
ocean. It feels like im drowing, but im not dying. Then out of no where 
theres a really big dude, and im talking like as big as a building. This
 guy doesnt have a face, and instead has a massive hole on his face." 
Erast got really into telling his dream, he began to cold sweat. He 
finally ended off his story "and i always wake up just before the dude 
ate me."</p><p class="center">He told yurie "ive been having this dream 
since i was 16, and the most recent time ive had this nightmare is last 
week. I dont think thats where my fear came from, but i think it really 
does nails it to my head that im scared of the ocean." Right after 
finishing off, the sudden realization that he was over sharing dawned on
 him. He could do nothing to take it back, so instead he asked "What 
about you ? What are you scared of ?"</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/6bbb8b5c9fb1b36d91523a6093d77b036eabdc7cr1-570-793v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

Listening to Jaxson’s story, she reviewed it a few times in her brain. 
And every time, the same person she knew came up in her mind. She nodded
 up to the Priest. “Reminds me a lot of a certain someone.” Samara 
looked down and looked at Mika, her hand resting on top of his head. 
“When we first met, I was trapped in the bathroom of a supermarket. I 
had been wounded and could barely stand, with an angry walker banging on
 the door to get inside. I thought I was going to die alone.”</p><p class="center italic">
 She continued to gently ruffle up Mika’s hair in slow circular motions.
 “And then he showed up. He saved me, and even stitched up my wound for 
me. Brought me all the way here, and he’s still the bravest kid I know. 
The sweetest, and overall just the most lively person.” She leaned back 
into the wall and turned her eyes to look back up at Jaxson, running her
 index finger against the stitching on her pants that showed where the 
wound was ripped. “And after he saved me from that walker, I tried to 
kill him. Isn’t that horrible? I just- raised my bat and took a swing 
right at the poor kid.”</p><p class="center italic"> She sighed and 
rubbed her forehead gently. “He was the first person I felt like I could
 trust for the first time in years of being out here on my own. I’ve 
been beat up, stolen from and nearly killed multiple times. But now, I 
feel like I can actually rest easy. All because of this little kid. I’m 
really grateful for him.”</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/52f51955a6b0a1c57624ff0983f06cda1a2f1ac0r1-828-827v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

wore his cloak so much he sometimes forgot that infected were still

 I'm a good guy. If you want, I can help you out, but you have to trust 
me. Okay?" He wasn't sure she'd trust him, she had no reason to. He 
looked weird as it was, wearing his bloddy cloak and a mask over his 
face. His brown hair poked out from under his hood, and his backpack 
made him look like a little bit of a hunchback. He'd always been told he
 had friendly eyes, though. Not necessarily ALWAYS good, but maybe in 
the situation they would be. He slowly took off his mask and hood, 
showing his messy hair and slight stubble that was growing on his face.

 tears away, although still doing those weird gasps for air that you do 
when you've been crying for a while. She then looked at the stranger 
again and looked at their hand, before very hesitantly shaking that

sound crazy, but I need you to hug me. Now hear me out, this cloak is 
big enough for two people, if I take off my backpack. Those undead

 was struggling, to say the least. Every point of interest he passed was
 a dead end with no river or source of water in sight, only more terrain
 to traverse. That wouldn’t be too bad of an issue, if he actually had 
some water with him, but alas, he definitely did not.</p><p>A pearl of 
sweat trickled its way down the king of greed’s face, pulling along dirt
 and other such unpleasantries that had stuck to his face during his 
travels. It travelled down past his drying lips and broke off its path 
to meet the ground below. This endless search for water was beginning to
 get really tiring at this point.</p><p>Akuma was a driven person, that 
much was clear, but he still knew his limits clear as day. Much more of 
this and he’d have to stop and take a break, in which case he would wake
 up even more dehydrated.</p><p>His breath was heavier than the usual as
 he crossed yet another hill, the landscape stretching out before him

Finally!</p><p>Akuma leapt from the hill, breaking out into a sprint 
down its side while mutters of things such as “Praise the lord” and “God

it rest along his side. Silent steps followed suit, as he began slowly 
traversing the insides of the ship. This thing truly has it all.. a bed

 Picking up the knife and his backpack, he said "I don't know what you

 gave him a quick nod , following behind him to the apartment building. 
Mabel was a hit weary of the night and the zombies that didn't seem to 
notice them. She slowly walked a bit closer to Connor , though that 
didn't seem to help as much when he was. . .7 inches shorter than her. 
She actually just realised it not sure how she didn't. Now she didn't 
see him as much as someone to be cautious of but again she didn't judge.
 With the way he wieldes that katana , one could imagine what he could 
do to a person. The closer the apartment came into view in the dark 
night's  atmosphere , the less worrisome she got. Feeling at ease , she 
decided to spark up a conversation to keep the awkwardness between them

 wanted to protest the other’s statement, but attempting to look at this
 situation from the other guy’s point of view made him realise that this
 seemed.. less than favourable for him. Some guy suddenly appears on 
your ship and tells you that he’s got a gun. Yeah, no, Akuma could 
totally see where he was coming from</p><p>“Yeah, I can sorta see that. 
But you’ve got one thing wrong, I’m not and was not threatening you. 
It’s fine to turn around, the gun isn’t even raised. It’s just.. better 
to be safe than sorry in this fucked up world, right? And yeah, I 
apologise for, uh, breaking into your ship and all that.”</p><p>He 
holstered the gun slowly, making sure to emphasise every motion and make
 as much sound as possible in order to get the message across. The best 
way of showing your adversary that you truly do not mean harm would be 
to remove your weapon from the conflict entirely, right?</p><p>Leaning 
back onto a wall, he let himself calm down slightly, his voice losing 
the slightly threatening yet lightly worried undertone.</p><p>“I 
would’ve told you why I came here the second I got on, but I just wanted
 to get my most important message across clearly and let you respond 
first. Monologuing for half an hour as my very first introduction to you
 wouldn’t really paint the perfect image of who I am, y’know?...</p><p>Although
 in hindsight, saying I have a gun on me probably isn’t much better to 
be honest. But again, precautions and all of that.”</p><p>Although Akuma
 had calmed down a bit, he was still tense. No matter how much he wanted
 this guy to be friendly, he didn’t know him at all. For all Akuma knew,
 he could be holding a gun with his other hand. In which case, our king 
of greed would be fucked.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/f7cee5c7ed0311feea7cf0d44989db2ced4dc416r1-159-158v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

asked, but there wasn't his usual warmth in his tone.</p><p>He was 
tired, and truthfully he was still mulling it over if he had made the

gentle sigh as he tapped the door a few times then opened the door.

 said nothing as he walked in  and started to climb the stairs to the

looked around a bit before nodding and sitting on the dusty sofa. He

to kill him. And Cy couldn't bear to live with that if he did, even if 
Nick was a killer. So putting distance between each other would prevent 
that.</p><p>"You'll be fine on your own, it seems like you can handle 
yourself with the infected well" he grumbled, refusing to look at Nick. 
Knowing that if he did he would give in to Nick's begging.</p><p>As much
 as he would want to help Nick, to team up with him, Cyrus couldn't 
afford to take that chance. He's made it this far into his life on his 
own, he wasn't going to let his softer side sabotage him.</p><p>Cyrus 
stopped speaking, focusing on Nick's leg as he dabbed the alcohol away 
with a swab, and began to sew up the cut. The air between them now was 
full of tension, although Cyrus was not angry. His face was stern and 
cold hearted as he stitched up Nick's wound, but there was also an 
uncomfortable full ache in Cy's chest.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message info-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="linkblue">

 Nick listened.. His face draining, full of pain. "No.. Its better for 
you.." He mumbled, then crossed his arms. He only felt pain and sadness 
in his life, but Cy made him think different.. Then he goes just like 
everyone else and turns his back on him. This dick.. He gritted his 
teeth then leaned back. He needs to keep his cool, even if he wanted to

another long swig from it, as he felt a bit tipsy now. He closed it and 
it slipped to the floor. "Oops.." He mumbled, as he groaned in pain

 finished stitching the cut, ignoring Nick's comment about the decision 
only benefitting Cy. Cy knew that if Nick were to try something, he'd 
have to kill him. And Cy didn't want that, so really in his mind he was 
protecting both of them. But he could tell Nick wouldn't understand 
that, after everything he's been through Cy couldn't blame him.</p><p>Cy
 gently wrapped a bandage around the wound, making sure it wasn't too 
tight. He watched Nick drop the flask to the floor, and picked it up. 
Setting the flask next to Nick he held out a pill bottle to him. "Here, 
take the bottle with you when you go tomorrow. It's full of painkillers,
 so at least you won't have to be hurting as much." His voice had a 
softer tone to it, although Cy still looked tired and cautious. At least
 Nick was looking tipsy, and he wouldn't be much of a threat now.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/981503dd5f91d1d58cc218787f13e458a9151532r1-300-300v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

mabey try and catch some Z's, but just as she was about to doze off the 
the land of dreams, she heard quite loud coughing below her in the 
streets "What the?" She then stood up and grabbed her binoculars, 
quickly searching for whatever was making that noise, and upon seeing it
 was someone crawling across the ground from a nearby flooded 
intersection she quickly put down her binoculars and hurried to grab her
 weapons before shaking Eia "Eia wake up! Grab your gun and the medkit 
and hurry behind me. There is someone out in the streets possibly 
injured from that nearby river and they aren't exactly being quite so I 
want to get them before any walkers come." She then hurried out of the

to her vest on and lighting her way. Once she was down on the ground she
 drew her shotgun before making her way over to the girl, but when she 
spoke she spoke in a loud whisper "You there! Are you ok?! Can you hear 
me?" She then briefly looked over her to make sure there were no 
immediate life threatening injuries "Good good no serious cuts that I 
can see...thought we should get you cleaned up before I look at you 
again." She then quickly looked around again knowing that if they didn't
 move soon walkers could possibly be on them "Can you stand? We have to

 sat down in the chair, watching Nick stumble around. Even though Cy was
 being vigilant, he struggled to hold in his laughter as he watched 
Nick. He grew tense though bas he saw Nick pull a gun from his bag and 
stood up, watching him carefully. When Nick put the gun down, Cy sighed 
in relief. He gave a tired sigh as he walked over to Nick and began to 
put Nick's things back into his bag. Cy took the gun and checked it for 
ammo, but felt pleased finding empty.</p><p>For a moment Cy forgot about
 the argument they had earlier, but he soon remembered and soured his 
mood. If things hadn't gone the way they did, he would have enjoyed 
Nick's company instead of being on edge.</p><p>Now he was stuck with a 
man who admitted to being a serial murderer, even though remorseful. And
 babysitting said serial murder while he was drunk. If future Cyrus went
 back to see himself 6 months ago, he wouldn't believe him when he said 
this would be what he was doing.</p><p>When Nick offered the can of 
beans to Cyrus, he couldn't help to give him an unsure half smile. He 
was still having trouble taking Nick seriously right now. "Uh, right.. 
Thank you" He laughed a little.</p><p>Cyrus sat down on his chair, 
running a hand through his long dirty blond hair. Cy was exhausted, 
emotionally and physically from the emotional rollercoaster he's been 
riding for the last few hours, stress showing on his face. He decided to
 give Nick some space, maybe he'd tire himself out. He sat close to his 
bow, although he figured he wouldn't have to use it.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/120bdbdcaa941adbfb411975feec721e918d0065r1-512-512v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 gave him a quick nod , following behind him to the apartment building. 
Mabel was a hit weary of the night and the zombies that didn't seem to 
notice them. She slowly walked a bit closer to Connor , though that 
didn't seem to help as much when he was. . .7 inches shorter than her. 
She actually just realised it not sure how she didn't. Now she didn't 
see him as much as someone to be cautious of but again she didn't judge.
 With the way he wieldes that katana , one could imagine what he could 
do to a person. The closer the apartment came into view in the dark 
night's  atmosphere , the less worrisome she got. Feeling at ease , she 
decided to spark up a conversation to keep the awkwardness between them

 wanted to protest the other’s statement, but attempting to look at this
 situation from the other guy’s point of view made him realise that this
 seemed.. less than favourable for him. Some guy suddenly appears on

totally see where he was coming from</p><p>“Yeah, I can sorta see that. 
But you’ve got one thing wrong, I’m not and was not threatening you. 
It’s fine to turn around, the gun isn’t even raised. It’s just.. better

holstered the gun slowly, making sure to emphasise every motion and make
 as much sound as possible in order to get the message across. The best 
way of showing your adversary that you truly do not mean harm would be 
to remove your weapon from the conflict entirely, right?</p><p>Leaning

the slightly threatening yet lightly worried undertone.</p><p>“I 
would’ve told you why I came here the second I got on, but I just wanted
 to get my most important message across clearly and let you respond 
first. Monologuing for half an hour as my very first introduction to you
 wouldn’t really paint the perfect image of who I am, y’know?...</p><p>Although
 in hindsight, saying I have a gun on me probably isn’t much better to 
be honest. But again, precautions and all of that.”</p><p>Although Akuma
 had calmed down a bit, he was still tense. No matter how much he wanted

could be important enough to make this man just put away his gun towards
 a stranger, especially since he himself didnt really have a reason to 
NOT kill him.</p><p class="center">╰─....🌿.──────────╯</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><!----><li class="timestamp">

 tilted his head to the side, and gave him an amused grin. Fragile? not 
the first word that would come to mind if Cy was describing himself, but
 Nick was drunk so he decided to humor him anyway.  "Hmm I don't know, 
I'm not sure if I can spy anything fragile. I give up, what is it?" he 
played along.</p><p>Even though he tried to play it off as him being

 " hmmm, oh, my name's Connor " he said as he looked at the female. 
Before jogging the last few feet to the apartment building. He gave a 
gentle sigh as he tapped the door a few times then opened the door. 
Honestly hoping to see someone he knew in the past, before all of the 
apocalypse went down. But he couldn't help it. This is what happened, he
 said nothing as he walked in  and started to climb the stairs to the 
first floor. Just opening the first door and pulling out his katana. He 
looked around a bit before nodding and sitting on the dusty sofa. He 
sighed slightly and said," get some rest kid, your gonna need it. . .

 grinned and nodded "Ah riiight, I should have known" he responded 
sarcastically, but also playfully. He would almost have forgotten that 
Nick had confessed to killing people just hours prior, and part of Cy 
had wished it wasn't true.</p><p>As Cy and Nick talked, memories of Cy's
 last group came flooding back to him. After joining a survivor group 
years ago, he grew close with a younger male survivor who'd lost his 
parents to the infected. Cy looked after the younger boy, treating him 
as one of his own brothers. Cyrus would teach the younger man how to 
defend himself, how to hunt, and also they would joke around frequently.
 Nick reminded Cyrus a lot of him.</p><p>A darker memory resurfaced 
though, how he tragically lost his adopted brother when the infected 
attacked. How Cyrus got the scar across his face. The memories rushed 
through him and he stood up suddenly, walking towards the far end of the
 watch tower and stared out the window, trying to push the painful 
memories away.</p><p>He stood there quietly for a moment, then spoke 
again, not looking at Nick. "You should go to bed, you need to rest 
before walking on that leg again" he said coldly. Cyrus turned back to 
Nick, leaning against the wall of the watch tower feeling drained of 
energy.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/1b5835525d922774da3329689e625cb276b997b1r1-736-736v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 Ellie was quite angry at the two of them. She knew they couldn’t have 
possibly lost someone – although it was inevitable in the apocalypse. 
They couldn’t have possibly felt the infuriating numbness you feel as 
you realise the person you love is truly gone. They couldn’t have 
possibly felt the guilt Ellie did as she lay on her bed the night Joel 
was murdered and she tried to bargain with herself. They couldn’t have 
possibly become so numb, so upset, so broken, they hardly ate or slept. 
Ellie didn’t eat for four and a half days after Joel’s death, and she 
landed in her community’s hospital.</p><p class="center"> Ellie placed 
her hands on her hips and sighed, “I’m going. You can’t stop me.” Her 
tone was still quite firm and full of irritation, but also quite 
exhausted. If this whole journey could be over in a click of Ellie’s 
fingers, she’d do it. But she knew it was not that easy. Still, Abby had
 to pay not only for Joel’s death but for Ellie’s girlfriend and their 
unborn child, Ellie’s best friend and her uncle’s deaths.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="timestamp">

 Presley walked through the alleys of the store, a pharmacy. The last 
couple places had been a bust, bare shelves, nothing but dust. But this 
one seemed more promising, not much canned food but that was usually 
rotten anyway, there was no use in gaining an illness. Her hand would 
slowly reach over to the box of bandaids, before slipping into a little 
duffle bag over her shoulder. Even most of the medicine was bad at that 
point, but it was always good to have. But the best find was seeds, 
flowers, of course, but most vegetables and fruit. Better food, a more 
effective food source. Presley didn’t really like people, it wasn’t 
worth getting close, being close with people just got you hurt, in more 
ways than one.</p><p class="center italic">Presley was dressed in a pair
 of rather worn out jeans, an old band shirt. It was beaten in and full 
of holes at that point. She wore combat boots, with tightly tied shoe 
laces. Fingerless gloves covered her hands, as she fiddled with a bag of
 cough drops. A gun at her lip, and a bat sticking out of her bag, a 
worn out handle on it. Her blonde hair hanging over her face in a messy 
way, nearly covering her blue eye. Her face was cover with dirty</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/f7cee5c7ed0311feea7cf0d44989db2ced4dc416r1-159-158v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 was outside, smoking a cigarette, the person he was trying to kill had 
just jumped off the bridge and gotten away. He was pissed off, maybe he 
was getting worse at this. He would have to lay a bit low for now, if he
 just continues to try to murder people he'll be recognized and get a 
reputation for murder. So he'd be laying low for now. The cigarette was 
finished and he threw the bus off the bridge into the water below the 
bridge. He sighed and started walking, not before long he found himself 
Infront of a pharmacy, he opened his bag and threw out two cans of b e a
 n s so he could make space for whatever was useful in the pharmacy, 
after doing that he entered it and started ya know, grabbing the stuff 
he could use. He wasn't trying to hide he was in there quite the 
opposite. If there was someone in there he could probably use them 
somehow, and then murder them after they stopped laying low. Or if it 
was a zombie he could just kill em for fun and their bones.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/60ab8315b4e2684a6168ac99a59dca29d817ca9br1-1799-1292v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 could hear the sound of someone or something  coming into the pharmacy.
 She would mumble under her breath “Shit.” She pressed herself up 
against the side of an aisle, doing her best to blend in with the items 
around her. Her blonde locks around fall into face as she listened to 
them roam around. It didn’t sound like a zombie, had to be human. She 
would slip her bat out of the bag, holding it tightly in her grip as she
 slowly made her way over towards the door, trying to keep an eye on 
him. ‘He’s just... standing out in the open?’ She would think, confused 
by it. Although before she could realize anything, her hand has slipped 
in a piece of glass, slicing the palm of her hand open. “Ugh.” She groan
 holding her hand tightly to try and prevent blood loss as she dug 
around in her bag for wrap or at least something she could use as a 
bandage.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/f7cee5c7ed0311feea7cf0d44989db2ced4dc416r1-159-158v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 then entered the pharmacy, not noticing anyone on the way in, or really
 in all reality he did notice the lady inside the pharmacy but he just 
ignored her, rather wanting her to greet him instead of him greeting 
her. Why you ask? I dunno maybe it would be stressful or something. So 
anyways he entered it and walked to one of the left aisles, humming a 
random  little tune while opening his bag and stuffing it fill with 
random stuff. Just random stuff didn't even need to be useful. But after
 a while of nothing he got tired of waiting and said semi loudly</p><p>"Hey lady, I know you're in here. I'm of no danger.

stuff on later."  For example he had created the greenhouse on top with a
 bunch of see through panels he had found in an old gardening shop.. 
they had books on how to raise your own plants as well, it was a great 
haul. Of course he had to tweak a few things, check that the boat

He didn't exactly appreciate the guy dragging a trail of water

way of taking in this new information.</p><p>"Nah, shes not my lover. I 
only met her a little while ago. I guess I still owe her something for 
sort of saving my life. Doubt she would be very happy if you woke her up

seemed to really struggle with falling asleep, so Lea would try his best
 to allow her some rest as long as he could.</p><p>"Hey hold on-" he tried to keep the stranger from entering the greenhouse but it was already too late.</p><p>The

 Fleur silently listened to the conversations around her, not saying 
much mostly because she was just tired. But when Maddison asked if they 
were together, she opened her mouth to speak. Danny beat her to it. 
Fleur lightly nodded, understanding where Maddison was coming from. 
“Most men and women out here together are couples or married.” She 
lifted up her hands to show she had no rings on, except for one wrapped 
around her thumb. But it was nothing like an engagement or wedding ring.
 “I’m lucky enough just to have a friend out here now.”</p><p class="center italic">
 She yawned and leaned back. Watching Danny pet the dog in front of him.
 It was nice to see a group of people slowly bonding, even though the 
world had seemed to have come to an end. “You were only looking after 
yourself, I don’t blame you.” She spoke about when she had first come 
across Daniel and he had a weapon pointed at her.</p><p class="center italic">

thought of fuck buddies. “Or maybe, you could take a step further and be
 a full blown couple.” She lightly laughed at them, then nodded when

 any nice people in the apocalypse at this point. Nice people don’t 
survive, that’s what her brother always told her. As the male turned the
 corner, Presley would look up at him, examining his face. She hadn’t 
noticed a weapon in hand, although that didn’t stop her from having 
hers. She’d paused for a moment, not saying anything even after he had 
introduced himself. “Presley.” She’d bow her head before looking around.
 “I suppose you could say that.” Presley said, thinking about it. It 
always seemed to be hard times, it was just how it went. “Supplies get 
harder and harder to find. Even harder to find stuff that’s not rotten 
or broken.” She’s sigh, not becoming less tense just yet.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/120bdbdcaa941adbfb411975feec721e918d0065r1-512-512v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 rested underneath a scarred tree. She bit her inner cheek, slowly 
standing up while still leaning up against the tree. She groaned out 
faintly, her eyepatch lazily hanging off her face as her right hand 
moved against her cheek. She then fixed her eyepatch, all the while her

 fit it back on. She looked up into the sky, letting the water hit her

 off in the far distance. A tree house.</p><p>She starred at it, before 
she unstrapped her backpack. It slammed into the ground, Elise crouching
 over it before she took out a mask made from a sheet of metal formed 
and warped to cover her face. It had two eye slots and multiple vents 
over where her mouth was, with several scratches and dents lining over 
it. She slid the mask on, adjusting it for a moment before putting her 
backpack on. She wore multiple plates of rusty scrap metal over a gray 
jacket, with her ebony hair tied back into a ponytail. She switched her 
hook hand for a ring shaped one before grabbing her axe. She slid the 
axe handle through the ring, before using the prosthetic's dial to 
tighten the ring around it. She then gripped the axe with her hand,

 wasn't long before Maxis had sat down on her little porch chair to 
mabey try and catch some Z's, but just as she was about to doze off the 
the land of dreams, she heard quite loud coughing below her in the 
streets "What the?" She then stood up and grabbed her binoculars, 
quickly searching for whatever was making that noise, and upon seeing it
 was someone crawling across the ground from a nearby flooded 
intersection she quickly put down her binoculars and hurried to grab her
 weapons before shaking Eia "Eia wake up! Grab your gun and the medkit 
and hurry behind me. There is someone out in the streets possibly 
injured from that nearby river and they aren't exactly being quite so I 
want to get them before any walkers come." She then hurried out of the 
room and made her way down the stairs, the flashlight she had strapped 
to her vest on and lighting her way. Once she was down on the ground she
 drew her shotgun before making her way over to the girl, but when she 
spoke she spoke in a loud whisper "You there! Are you ok?! Can you hear 
me?" She then briefly looked over her to make sure there were no 
immediate life threatening injuries "Good good no serious cuts that I 
can see...thought we should get you cleaned up before I look at you 
again." She then quickly looked around again knowing that if they didn't
 move soon walkers could possibly be on them "Can you stand? We have to 
hurry and get you inside."</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/df221d68dd59ba031751c02e0c6ba4a0669d5caar1-1202-1207v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 brunette stared at the other for a moment, frozen in disbelief before 
his brain clicked and he snorted in amusal, reaching up to pinch the 
bridge of his nose. "I swear, I was very close to throwing you off with 
my own two hands." He admitted with a grin.</p><p>"I didn't make it 
entirely, it eas originally a regular houseboat. I just added useful 
stuff on later."  For example he had created the greenhouse on top with a
 bunch of see through panels he had found in an old gardening shop.. 
they had books on how to raise your own plants as well, it was a great 
haul. Of course he had to tweak a few things, check that the boat 
wouldnt get too heavy from the wooden frame, keep everything balanced in
 order to advoid it tipping in bad weather..that kind of stuff..</p><p>Leander
 followed closely as the strange man began to tour around his ship, 
going sure that he would not cause any harm or take anything with him. 
He didn't exactly appreciate the guy dragging a trail of water 
everywhere, but he was honestly kind of amused by his strange, greedy 
way of taking in this new information.</p><p>"Nah, shes not my lover. I 
only met her a little while ago. I guess I still owe her something for 
sort of saving my life. Doubt she would be very happy if you woke her up
 now tho." He commented, crossing his arms with a raised brow. She had 
seemed to really struggle with falling asleep, so Lea would try his best
 to allow her some rest as long as he could.</p><p>"Hey hold on-" he tried to keep the stranger from entering the greenhouse but it was already too late.</p><p>The
 brunette rested a hand on the gun at his hip, his eyes squinted. "Don't
 get any ideas, alright? If I see you take anything without 
permission.." he threatened</p><p class="center">╰─.. ..🌿.──────╯</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/2c11c208a784c4074d19c7b5789af83ccf78f2a3r1-512-512v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 was whistling away while he cleaned his knife in the river. The last 
thing you wanted was a knife with gunk on it. He heard a twig crack and 
his hand shot to his gun, but when he saw Stica he dropped his hand. 
"What's up with you?" he asked "You look like you've seen a ghost." He 
flicked his knife to get the water off then wiped it on his jeans, then 
cupped some water in his hands and took a drink.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/2c11c208a784c4074d19c7b5789af83ccf78f2a3r1-512-512v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 know what you mean." Leander voiced,  sitting down at the front of the 
boat, where the water gently lapped up its sides. The houseboat had 
drifted off into the soft waters of a lake. Losing some momentum in the 
calmer waters, the boat eventually came to a halt, only lightly wiggling
 from side to side on top of the water.</p><p>"Well..about a day ago, I 
had decided to check out the nearest city to scavenge for supplies. A 
cracked up manhole just collapsed under me while I was walking, lucky 
enough I fell onto the waters below and didn't get hurt. So I'm sitting 
their, dripping wet and confused, when I suddenly hear some bigass 
Shambler behind me. It tried to grab me, but the sewer water made me 
slippery so I got away just in time. I ran through the canals trying to 
find an exit when I stumbled upon two others that were camping down 
there. She set the bad boy on fire and kept the only exit open for me to
 get out..so she did kind of save my ass." He figured with a shrug and a
 cheeky grin. "Woulda survived by myself too tho." He claimed, pulling 
up his water flask to take a deep sip.</p><p class="center">╰─....🌿.──────────╯</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/2c11c208a784c4074d19c7b5789af83ccf78f2a3r1-512-512v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

It's already long past dark." He adjusted his hood and took off his

 then got to work collecting large branches. He took an old looking 
hatchet from his bag and started cutting up these branches. "If you 
don't want to be completely useless, try finding some leaves. About a 
foot across, they HAVE to be big."</p><p>Toby then started leaning the

 the highest floor in an abandoned building a looming figure was 
observing the city with binoculars. This 20 floors building was serving 
as A.k s hideout. Hardly any zombie goes this high and the building is 
clean from them. The sun was starting to settle on the horizon as he put
 down the binoculars. After shaving as best as he could with his sharp 
knife the beard from a small broken mirror he put on his clothes and his
 black cowboy hat. Always making sure to lock the door behind this 
office he made into his home from rearranging all the furnitures he 
arrives at the broken lift . Because power went out years ago he was 
using the metal cables to grapple down to the ground floor. Carefully 
checking if any zombies were there he deducted the place was clear.</p><p class="italic center">After
 arriving at ground floor and exiting from the back of the building he 
opened the map to check for possible places to raid. Some shops nearby 
should have some cans if they weren't raided by now. He put a black mask
 like a desperado and started heading for the shops, taking all the 
shortcuts and staying out of sight or open roads . It was raining 
slightly so he put bottles of water to fill up at the roof and should be
 full by the time he got back. The streets were filled with dead people 
or eaten. A sight that no longer affected A.k . For him it looked 
natural almost. Adapt or perish like the rest. He had some encounters 
with other people. Some were ok, some were trying to put a bullet in his
 brain, though he always was one step ahead. His calmness at the face of
 danger helped him prevail. Nah it was his ruthlessness and smart 
decisions that helped him survive so far. And he d do anything to remain
 the apex predator. He opened the map and check his next place to raid.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/bd0682bce31c0b94c43e11cffc93d7bbbd7a0b17r1-408-366v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

was still dark out and when he turned his head sam was laying across

 an uncomfortable  position.A soft sigh echoed from him, bucking up form
 the bed with a yawn. He quickly placed a had to  his forehead, it was

  with a loud yawn while his feet sunk into the soft blades of carpet.</p><p class="center">
 Last nights meal had gone untouched, stumbling across to the microwave 
he picked at some of his  food before prepping to head out for alittle. 
He knew exactly where the hotel was located  so he wasn't  worried he'd 
 get lost, packing some of the more important drinks and food into his 
bag. He left behind his special  collection  trusting it to sam while he
 was away, balancing his palm against the silver door handle and his 
other hand holding the barrel of his gun dearly, his pockets rattling 
with bullets as he stepped into the flithy hotel hall and up towards the
 stair case. It reeked just as every time they walked past, the lobby  
was a breeding house for bacterial infections. He wanted to  move out as
 fast as he could, swinging  the front glass doors open and seeping into
 the isolated  street. Not an organism in sight, it was terrifyingly

infested like a hive of bees. He'd have to clear them out if he wanted 
to get to the safe, and he had to get to the safe to get the food. He 
groaned quietly and continued running. Mikey was always good a running, 
more than once he'd been call a "speedy little shit". It made him smile 
to know that people thought he was worth a curse.</p><p class="center">Finally,
 he made it to the store. It wasn't that big, sure, but who knew how 
many infected were in it. He went to the door. Out of his backpack he 
took his tool bag. "Hmmm..." he said, trying to decide which one to use.
 After a glance at the glass doors, he chose the crowbar. The window was
 split in two, but he was big enough to shimmy through the lower part. 
"Hiya!" he said, making a noise like a ninja as he smashed the window. 
After tossing his backpack through, he carefully squeezed through the 
window. Not carefully enough, though, as he cut himself on a share of 
glass. "Fuck!" he yelled loudly, and slapped a hand over his mouth. 
Damn, the cut was deep, and bleeding a lot. No matter, he had a job to 
do. "Tis but a scratch." he mumbled to himself, making his way into the 
store as he put on his backpack, careful of his fresh cut.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="timestamp">

boat, where the water gently lapped up its sides. The houseboat had 
drifted off into the soft waters of a lake. Losing some momentum in the 
calmer waters, the boat eventually came to a halt, only lightly wiggling
 from side to side on top of the water.</p><p>"Well..about a day ago, I

Shambler behind me. It tried to grab me, but the sewer water made me 
slippery so I got away just in time. I ran through the canals trying to 
find an exit when I stumbled upon two others that were camping down 
there. She set the bad boy on fire and kept the only exit open for me to
 get out..so she did kind of save my ass." He figured with a shrug and a

explore around the building. There was debris from different parts of

charred and it's hands were clawed somehow. It's eyes, well if you can 
call them that, were just two bright white spots on where it's face 
would be.  The right side of it's chest was just open, no organs, just a
 charred ribcage, and the meat of a deer. It then grabbed it's

 Ellie was quite angry at the two of them. She knew they couldn’t have 
possibly lost someone – although it was inevitable in the apocalypse. 
They couldn’t have possibly felt the infuriating numbness you feel as 
you realise the person you love is truly gone. They couldn’t have 
possibly felt the guilt Ellie did as she lay on her bed the night Joel 
was murdered and she tried to bargain with herself. They couldn’t have 
possibly become so numb, so upset, so broken, they hardly ate or slept. 
Ellie didn’t eat for four and a half days after Joel’s death, and she 
landed in her community’s hospital.</p><p class="center"> Ellie placed 
her hands on her hips and sighed, “I’m going. You can’t stop me.” Her 
tone was still quite firm and full of irritation, but also quite 
exhausted. If this whole journey could be over in a click of Ellie’s 
fingers, she’d do it. But she knew it was not that easy. Still, Abby had
 to pay not only for Joel’s death but for Ellie’s girlfriend and their 
unborn child, Ellie’s best friend and her uncle’s deaths.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message from-me"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/1e56d3cef4a4e6a52303bffe4865a7163cab8169r1-1877-2048v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><!----> <div class="message-content"><div class="text-msg rich-content"><p>(We could say they got seperated after they're attacked as you wanted to do.)</p></div> <!----></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/133edf472bef26ff2c15aaee9384ba7fbc2a39eer1-448-326_68.gif" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

into the creature's eyes, drawing his knife. This was certainly strange

 froze, indeed seeing A.K.'s shadow. An infected? Another human 
possibly? In a settlement, you wouldn't have to worry too much about 
people. In the wasteland, though, everything changed. It was everyone 
for themselves. He ducked behind a shelf and peered through it at the 
dark figure in the window high above him. "I don't want any trouble..." 
Mikey said "I'm just... looking for food, like you." He was unsure of 
how this stranger would react, but Mikey wouldn't hesitate to fight. He 
drew his baton from the side pocket on his backpack and, as silent as he

 stepped back, looking at their handiwork. "Hm, probably should've made 
more room..." he sighed "It's too small for both of us, so you can sleep
 in there. I'll just use my cloak for protection." He nodded and took 
off his cloak, sitting up against the tree next to the entrance. He 
pulled up his cloak like a blanket "Sleep well." He was used to making 
shelters for one person, himself, and he'd unconsciously done that 
again, leaving no room for another person. He didn't mind the rain,

 Ellie stayed almost still for a few moments, continuing to point the 
gun at Ryuto. The only movement that came from her was the shaking of 
her hands, until she heard Ezra talk. Her attention immediately snapped 
to him. She felt almost a feeling of joy and satisfaction when Ezra 
agreed to go. She let her hands drop to her side and she brushed a 
finger over her revolver (which actually was her dad’s) before placing 
it back into its holster on her thigh. She would avenge her father at 
any cost.</p><p class="center"> The girl watched as Ezra hurried towards
 the door and for a second, she let herself feel that joy, satisfaction 
and angry determination that pushed her to carry on her vengeful quest. 
Suddenly, she saw a glint of light out of the corner of her eye but as 
soon as she turned her head to the side, to look out at the window where
 it came from, it was gone. She frowned, confused, then shook it off. It
 was one singular light, probably from someone’s flashlight as it was 
quite dark, and as they had not turned it off, they must not know that 
Ellie, Ezra and Ryuto were in the building. It would be three against 
one, anyway.</p><p class="center"> ((Ya'll want me to write the starter for the ppl to attack now or what?))</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/f7cee5c7ed0311feea7cf0d44989db2ced4dc416r1-159-158v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 in the slightest.</p><p class="center">The girls sharp tone, paired

 was just fucking sobbing while he was explaining this, it was like 
watching a teacher telling a sobbing three year old mathematics. But 
anyhow after a minute she stopped crying, wiped her tears and did as 
explained. She didn't really understand how it would work or why it 
worked but she knew how to do it at least so that's something. What an 
odd odd experience with zombie, not to mention terrifying.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message info-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="linkblue">

 damon had been sleeping in the carpark for a few weeks now, he has 
cleared a whole floor of any infected and had made sure he had a section
 of his own.. he slept inside a broken van that he had put a matress in 
and taken out all chairs and other things that a normal car would need. 
at the local college he took a mini fridge that worked on a car battery 
he found in one of the cars at the edge of the city.. he had a whole 
collection of rear view mirror decorations :) damon loved collecting 
stuff and the decorations were the most common stuff available no one 
really needed..</p><p class="center italic">the fact damon was mute was 
actually pretty useful during an apocalypse, he learned how to be very 
stealthy so almost he could easily sneak in and out a building without 
any other survivors hearing him or being heard by the infected.. he 
really did not mind not being able to speak, people left him alone when 
they realized he couldn't and he had no one to talk to anyway.. right 
now damon was in the forest with his shotgun in his hand ready to shoot 
whatever he saw, he was quite hungry and had picked some berries and 
nuts but was now looking for some meat.. he wasn't the best in hunting 
but usually it went okay</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/f7cee5c7ed0311feea7cf0d44989db2ced4dc416r1-159-158v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 listened to the stranger’s response, nodding along to the entire thing.
 Scavenging for supplies was a totally normal part of everyday life at 
this point, so that part of the story wasn’t anything unusual.</p><p>“Damn, you just fell through like that? Must’ve scared the shit out of you..” Akuma snickered lightly following this remark.</p><p>“What
 the fuck, a shambler? Jesus christ..” While listening to all of this, 
he could not help but imagine himself in Leander’s shoes. What would he 
have done if he was suddenly chased down by a shambler, of all things? 
No matter how highly he might think of himself, he had to admit that he 
would probably die in such a situation. Dangerous stuff. As Leander 
finished up his story, Akuma leant back on the railing and exclaimed.</p><p>“Damn, she must be one badass person, then. Seems like you’ve been through a lot in just these past few days..”</p><p>Listening to the storyteller’s last remark, he smirked himself and responded.</p><p>“Oh
 of course you would’ve survived, that’s a given.” Akuma stopped, his 
expression darkening coupled with a hit to his general mood.</p><p>“Aye,
 mind if I tell my own story? I know that sounds really selfish, but

 you are looking for food you are in bad luck. This place was raided 
before I got here." He jumped down and started walking towards him 
slowly, the sound of the boots echoing in the silence after his talk. 
A.k seemed to know what to say and how to hurt someone with words alone.
 But it seemed like this day would get way more interesting.</p><p class="italic center">I'd
 save my ammunition or my baton if I were you . With that cut in your 
hand you can swing like what? 2 or 3 times at full strength before the 
stinging pain reduces your damage output?" A.k moved at a distance of 
1.5 meters to the right from the shelves so as to avoid being charged in
 with a baton or having enough space to draw his desert eagle. And 
judging by the clumsy man he didn't have to worry about him at all. As 
he moved he appeared in front of him at a maximum 1.7 meters distance. 
At this distance even if he charges at a.k would be a huge no no as he 
ll be gunned down before he realizes.</p><p>But then a.k pointed his finger at the broken window he opened.</p><p class="italic center">Won't
 you say hi to the visitors you brought with you here?" Huge growlings 
were heard from the window as two or three hands tried to break in at 
the same time.</p><p class="italic center">It appears we got two choises
 ahead of us. You got probably plenty of time to patch your hand with a 
bandaid then deal with the walkers yourself . Show me your resolve and I
 might assist you . Show that you can kill all 3 of them in 3 swings 
because if you don't you ll be eaten." A.k grabbed a chair and sat down 
observing him. This man was dangerous. And extremely adept to his 
environment. He was gonna test him to see whether he has what it takes. 
And judging by his voice he might seriously leave him to his fate. Or 
not. who knows for sure?</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message info-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="linkblue">

 Ellie turned her attention back to Ezra and watched as he left the 
store. Her gaze lingered on the closed door for a few minutes as she 
felt a sudden feeling of loss. Why? Why did she feel like she had lost a
 friend? She barely knew him but he had helped her. And he was helping 
her now. She let herself breathe out a small sigh. And that's when the 
shot fired.</p><p class="center"> It broke through the glass window and 
the bullet flew past Ellie’s ear, rooting itself into the wall behind 
her. She immediately crouched down and slammed her back against the 
wall, hiding herself. “Ryuto, get down!” She yelled at the boy although 
that was probably his first thought. “Who the fuck is that?” She 
whispered to herself in a sharp tone, quickly skimming through a list of
 the people she had wronged in her brain. There were too many to narrow 
it down to someone. Maybe they were just people trying to rob them?</p><p class="center">
 More shots came flying into the shop and Ellie placed herself onto her 
elbows. She army crawled to the window the first shot had come from and 
pulled her silenced submachine gun out of her backpack. She had no other
 long range weapon. Ellie peeked her head above the window, only to 
crouch back down again as a bullet came her way. It seemed like there 
was a group of about ten in the shop across from them.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/49ad10c99571679d901a5499ca217f6779080aebr1-500-750_68.gif" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 Ellie gritted her teeth and pulled a smoke bomb out of her backpack. 
She threw it across towards the shop, narrowly missing a bullet to her 
shoulder, and she watched as a small explosion occurred, obscured by a 
thick wall of smoke. Then, Ellie started shooting with her gun. She 
couldn’t see the people but more so she saw their outlines and shot at 
them. She heard cries of pain as she shot and bit down hard on her 
bottom lip, pleased with herself that she was hitting them. Killing 
them. She wouldn’t die. Not here, not yet.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message info-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="linkblue">

point in hiding anything in what he was about to say. Not that he had 
much to hide anyways..</p><p>“43 days ago today, I still had a group to

our lives to the fullest! ‘Fullest’ being to the extent this strange 
situation would let us. It all went smoothly. A hiccup or argument every
 now and then, sure, but I was quick to solve it with them whenever it 
arose. We were a tight-knit group.”</p><p>Akuma was smiling, his mind 
clouded with memory upon memory of the time he had spent with his group,
 which now felt like such a short amount. Way too short.</p><p>“Considering
 the fact that I don’t have a group now, you’ve probably already guessed
 what happened next. We were overran, which is an impressive feat 
considering we were probably one of the larger groups in a pretty wide 
radius. 14 people is nothing to scoff at. But no matter, we were still 
completely unprepared. About 10 people appeared, and under normal 
circumstances, we would’ve probably come out of the ensuing conflict as 
the victors.

 Cy had heard Nick snoring, he felt it would be best if he left now, 
avoiding a painful goodbye the next morning. He snuck around quietly, 
using his stealth skills to make sure he wasn't making hardly any noise.
 Even so, would check Nick once in a while to make sure he didn't wake 
up. With all of his things packed, he grabbed his cloak and began to 
leave the guard tower. Before he left though, he folded Nick's hoodie, 
left him some cans of food and some ammo for Nick's gun that he'd found.
 An apology of sorts.</p><p>Even though Cy felt undoubtedly guilty about leaving, especially without saying goodbye, he knew it was better this way.</p><p>Cy
 had left the guard tower hours before Nick woke up, and was miles away 
towards the edge of town. Cy was heading to the woods, he figured it 
would be safer there since there weren't as many infected, and he could 
properly hunt and gather food there.</p><p>Once he was at the boarder of
 the town near the edge of the woods, Cy was on the lookout for any 
place he could scavenge for food. He climbed up a two story building 
using the fire escape stairs, and decided he would stick to the rooftops
 to have a better vantage point. Even though he was afraid of heights, 
he knew he'd have a tactical advantage being up so high. No one could 
notice him unless they were looking, and infected weren't smart enough 
to climb to the rooftops. Plus he was a great shot with his bow, and 
being higher up would be easier for him to attack if need be.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/0d87536e7125f2ce7c2ee9f96c4f5cc3e6c8f7cbr1-1152-2048v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 you are looking for food you are in bad luck. This place was raided 
before I got here." He jumped down and started walking towards him 
slowly, the sound of the boots echoing in the silence after his talk. 
A.k seemed to know what to say and how to hurt someone with words alone.
 But it seemed like this day would get way more interesting.</p><p class="italic center">I'd
 save my ammunition or my baton if I were you . With that cut in your 
hand you can swing like what? 2 or 3 times at full strength before the 
stinging pain reduces your damage output?" A.k moved at a distance of 
1.5 meters to the right from the shelves so as to avoid being charged in
 with a baton or having enough space to draw his desert eagle. And 
judging by the clumsy man he didn't have to worry about him at all. As 
he moved he appeared in front of him at a maximum 1.7 meters distance. 
At this distance even if he charges at a.k would be a huge no no as he 
ll be gunned down before he realizes.</p><p>But then a.k pointed his finger at the broken window he opened.</p><p class="italic center">Won't
 you say hi to the visitors you brought with you here?" Huge growlings 
were heard from the window as two or three hands tried to break in at 
the same time.</p><p class="italic center">It appears we got two choises
 ahead of us. You got probably plenty of time to patch your hand with a 
bandaid then deal with the walkers yourself . Show me your resolve and I
 might assist you . Show that you can kill all 3 of them in 3 swings 
because if you don't you ll be eaten." A.k grabbed a chair and sat down 
observing him. This man was dangerous. And extremely adept to his 
environment. He was gonna test him to see whether he has what it takes. 
And judging by his voice he might seriously leave him to his fate. Or 
not. who knows for sure?</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/1b5835525d922774da3329689e625cb276b997b1r1-736-736v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 sighed as Tobias had ended the semi argument right there. She just 
slowly crawled back into the shelter and closed her eyes. But of course 
not before seeing those two bright eyes in a two starring down at her. 
And then her eyes were wide open, just starring back at the charred 
zombie from before. It was crouched, on a branch, like a slav squat. She
 was petrified, didn't even make noise except for like, a couple wimpers
 or something. But after a while, she did fall asleep. Not before 
hearing the crunching of leaves getting farther and farther away as the 
charred zombie left. And so she slept.</p><p>I guess it's,</p><p class="bolder center italic"> T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-TIME SKIP TIME</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/f4457f77ff5d50636fc0f60f1608a1c26e1bbde1r1-320-320v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 groaned "Whatever man, I don't have time for this." He grabbed a 
lighter from the front cash register and a screwdriver. He lit the 
lighter after a few tried and heated the screwdriver. Taking a deep 
breath he held the screwdriver to his cut. His scream was muffled 
through his gritted teeth and he hit his head on a nearby shelf a couple
 of times. Finally, he removed the screwdriver and tossed it aside. It 
was crude, but it would have to do. He lifted the baton in his hand, his
 non cut hand, his dominant hand. He hadn't expected this stranger to 
know he was left-handed, the world before the apocalypse had been 
dominantly right-handed. Things didn't change as much as everyone 
thought they did.</p><p>He looked at the stranger, now ticked off. 
"Three swings, huh?" he smiled as he wiped his sweaty forehead "Deal." 
He twirled the baton and stood in front of the doors. He looked back at 
the stranger and winked. The doors burst open and Mikey took off, the 
SLS, speedy little shit. He ducked down beneath the outstretched hand of
 the forwardmost infected. He brought his right hand up and around his 
neck, throwing his body over his shoulder. "Bitch!" he yelled as he 
brought his foot down on his skull, which caved in with a sickening 
crunch. The next was on him before he could react, but he managed to 
break away. He brought the baton around it's neck and wrenched down, his
 knee colliding with the zombie's forehead. Quickly backing up, he 
looked at the last infected, in her eyes. Quick as a flash, the baton 
whipped out and cracked against her temple. She crumpled to the floor 
and didn't get up. Mikey looked at the stranger "One."</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/f4457f77ff5d50636fc0f60f1608a1c26e1bbde1r1-320-320v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 jerked awake from a nightmare, his heart racing and his breath quick 
and ragged. He looked around frantically, though he saw nothing. "Jesus 
H. Christ." he said, wiping his forehead. Soon he calmed down, and he 
ran a hand through his hair. After a moment he remembered Stica. Looking
 at her, he made sure she was okay before he leaned his head back

 Nick made it into town, as he started to walk down a street. He didnt 
know what street he was even on, but he assumed it was one crawling with
 infected due to the groans he kept hearing. He slipped into a building 
carefully, scavaging for water. Instead he found a pack of cigarette and
 a lighter, next to a dead corpse. He shrugged and grabbed it, putting 
it into his bag. He doesnt usual smoke but why not just start. Its the 
end of the world anyway. He would much rather die due to lung 
disfunction than get eaten alive.</p><p class="center italic">✏ The male
 then slipped out of the shop, and kept walking down the street. He took
 out a cigarette and lit it, inhailing it then exhaling. He left out a 
gentle cough, clearing his throat after. He walked down the street, 
occasionally inhailing the smoke. He saw a female and a baby, as he 
paused, and put it out. Should he manipulate them? He should.. Thats 
what he is made for though. Maybe kill the woman and take the baby. No, 
thatll be really hard. He put his fun in his back pocket, as he walked 
up to the two. "Hey, you seem a little lost. Do you need some help? Or 
need anything in general?" He asked, shooting a kind smile towards her.</p><p class="center italic">2/2</p><p class="center">╚══════════════ ☁ ═╝</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/6e7ab16d6255f197db66ee566f7198cbf208a6b3r1-1242-1248v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 groaned "Whatever man, I don't have time for this." He grabbed a 
lighter from the front cash register and a screwdriver. He lit the 
lighter after a few tried and heated the screwdriver. Taking a deep 
breath he held the screwdriver to his cut. His scream was muffled 
through his gritted teeth and he hit his head on a nearby shelf a couple
 of times. Finally, he removed the screwdriver and tossed it aside. It 
was crude, but it would have to do. He lifted the baton in his hand, his
 non cut hand, his dominant hand. He hadn't expected this stranger to 
know he was left-handed, the world before the apocalypse had been 
dominantly right-handed. Things didn't change as much as everyone 
thought they did.</p><p>He looked at the stranger, now ticked off. 
"Three swings, huh?" he smiled as he wiped his sweaty forehead "Deal." 
He twirled the baton and stood in front of the doors. He looked back at 
the stranger and winked. The doors burst open and Mikey took off, the 
SLS, speedy little shit. He ducked down beneath the outstretched hand of
 the forwardmost infected. He brought his right hand up and around his 
neck, throwing his body over his shoulder. "Bitch!" he yelled as he 
brought his foot down on his skull, which caved in with a sickening 
crunch. The next was on him before he could react, but he managed to 
break away. He brought the baton around it's neck and wrenched down, his
 knee colliding with the zombie's forehead. Quickly backing up, he 
looked at the last infected, in her eyes. Quick as a flash, the baton 
whipped out and cracked against her temple. She crumpled to the floor 
and didn't get up. Mikey looked at the stranger "One."</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message info-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="linkblue">

 looks around making sure he doesn’t have anyone else with him who could
 be a potential threat. From her first impression he doesn’t seem like 
someone who would kill for no reason. He seemed upset and very focused 
about something but they just met, it wasn’t her place to ask or say 
anything about it. She looks back at him making sure he hasn’t done 
anything with the bow. “Well, I’m Savannah. Nice to meet you.” She 
smiles back at him.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message info-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="linkblue">

 nodded, and tilted his head to the side as he listened. His face 
turning solum as Savannah explained her situation. "I'm sorry to hear 
that, that must have been really hard trying to survive on your own like
 that" he tried to sound consoling.</p><p>"I'm no stranger to 
manipulation either. After surviving alone for so long, I realized 
pretty quick that a lot of people are desperate in these hard times, 
unfortunately desperate enough to hurt other people." He agreed with 
Savannah, looking down at his feet. He couldn't help but think back to 
the few times he was scammed and almost killed when he was younger after
 he had to leave from his group.</p><p>He brushed his hand against his 
own cheek where a scar had ran through his face, remembering all of the 
times he'd had one particular close call with a group of people, leading
 to the nasty scar. And he thought of Nick, but pushed the thought away.</p><p>"Well,
 I'm looking for supplies too right now. We could go out together 
tomorrow to see if we can find anything we need. If we stick together we
 can at least watch out for one another. If you want" He offered with a 
kindly smile, but didn't push so hard when he asked. Hearst needed 
supplies and knew they'd have better chances sticking together. But he 
appeared to be an understanding person, and wouldn't be bothered if 
Savannah refused.</p><p>He knew what it was like to have to be so 
restless around other people, and plus he knew what it was like to be in
 Savannah's shoes before Hearst transitioned. It was scary being a woman
 in a world where men were already violent, and now even moreso after 
the infection. He had seen men go to extremes like murdering others, 
turning to cannibalism, and even worse things. He wouldn't be surprised 
if Savannah had seen that too</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><!----><!----><!----><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/0cbe493aaa6bd1cec3011fd596048d1dc44ccf87r1-714-1024v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 she was listening to Hearst speak she realized how much they had in 
common with that situation. It felt comforting to Savannah to know she 
wasn’t the only one getting manipulated but also felt sorry for all the 
stuff he said that happened to him. No one really deserves any of that 
to happen to them. “I’m sorry that type of stuff has happened to you” 
she said sympathetically. “It’s really sad people are like that.”</p><p class="center">She
 listens to his offer and is a bit hesitant at first. Every time someone
 in the past who has said that has been someone who tries to manipulate 
or kill her. But this time it felt different to her. It felt like this 
was a true genuine offer of them sticking together. Besides it would be 
better to have two people looking out for each other then just one. She 
looks at him, “if you want to I would definitely come with.” She smiles 
hoping this time will be different than any other time in the past. 
Maybe this could be the first time she doesn’t have to be completely 
scared when leaving the rooftop. Of course we are still in an 
apocalypse, but for once not just scared for her life from other people.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/1b5835525d922774da3329689e625cb276b997b1r1-736-736v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 was up and walking around the small shack that he was held up in. There
 were hardly any infected species out where he was however that didn't 
mean he was safe. His hair was greasy, his clothes were stained with 
blood, sweat, vomit most of which likely belong to him. He was stock 
piling a few materials to make weapons with and planned on heading out 
to move on to another location. He never stayed in one place too long. 
That was a good way to get killed. He refurbished an old tool belt he 
found at a warehouse he came across on his way to this swampy area 
nearly three months ago. He had transformed it into "mainly" a weaponry 
holder. A sheath for his pistol, a holder for a molotov (if he ever made
 one), and a place for a water bottle and a few smaller blades. He had a
 backpack that he refurbished as well in order to hold up two katana 
like blades.</p><p>Things that were a necessity in this new age he also 
spent years collecting. He had a gas mask for emergencies but that often
 sat in his bag while he used a bandanna for the most part. He had small
 tools that were once used by scouts or soldiers for outdoor survival 
purposes, and of course things like a map and a compass. Kane was 
running out of ammo for his pistol and was in desperate need for a 
medkit. He was outrunning an infected when he had to make a risky jump 
from a reasonably high place. He was lucky that he got away with nothing
 more than a bruise and a stab wound. He had ignorantly busted through a
 window and when he landed, a moderately sized piece of glass lodged 
itself in his side. It was a bad enough wound that he had to cauterize 
it. This used up the last of his old medkit.</p><p>It was time to brave the outdoors once again.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/0cbe493aaa6bd1cec3011fd596048d1dc44ccf87r1-714-1024v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 gotta look out for each other". He leaned back and looked up at the 
stars as well, mentally noting some constellations he recognized. His 
eyes began to feel heavy as he started to feel the effects of sleep 
deprivation. Hearst didn't get good sleep in general because of his 
nightmares, and after that last night with Nick he didn't sleep at all.</p><p>He
 looked back to Savannah when she asked about the woods. "As far as I've
 experienced, the woods are usually safer. When the infection hit there 
were more people in the city than in the more rural areas. So, less 
infected." He explained in a straightforward fashion. This had been his 
experience for the most part, and for most of his time alone he'd stuck 
to the rural areas. However there were the rare cases where he'd find 
people who had the same idea as Hearst and lived in the woods as well. 
And sometimes there would be infected lingering nearby.</p><p>"Would it 
be alright if I stayed the night here?" he asked, quirking a brow at 
Savannah in question. "I could move to a different rooftop, but you have
 a good idea staying up here. It's safer, and it's been a while since

 he walked backwards and gave his warning as to being no threat she felt

 Nick hummed a tune as he listened to her talk. "And yeah they all 
turned. I saw it happen too. I think its called.. Trauma? Or memories. 
Me and my mother didnt get to finish my school, as she got devoured when
 I was 8." He said, shrugging it off. Flashbacks flashed before his 
eyes, as he bit his inner cheek. "And yeah I get how you feel about 
that.. Its hard to fight your own kind. I mean, we are all humans.. We 
should share and be kind, but everyone imare selfish pricks.." He said. 
When he said that, Hearst rushed through his mind. That dick. One of his
 hands clenched into fists, as he tried to keep his breathing under 
control.</p><p class="center italic">✏ he chuckled at what she cackled 
at. He then put a small smile on his face being asked that question. All
 he thought about hearing that question was Hearst.. Why Hearst?! He met
 so many people who wouldnt trade nick for the world, but he murdered 
them in self pity. And yet Hearst ran through his mind.  He wanted to 
hit himself so he could think normal. Forget about that man. Nick 
sighed. "Yeah, many.. But they all turned infront of me. Well, got 
eaten. Im surpised I even survived this long." He said, smiling still 
and turning to her. He then saw that they were here. "Were here! Want to
 climb up first? Ill carry your bag." He said holding a hand out. 
"Unless you want me to go first."</p><p class="center">╚══════════════ ☁ ═╝</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message info-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="linkblue">

feeling in the depths of her stomach. For a moment she stared her dark

 the words she was looking for. It was at the tip of her tongue, but she
 couldn't quite place it.  She slid her bag off her shoulder handing it

looked at her his dark glossy eyes.</p><p class="center italic"> Bish 
made sure to check her strap for the child carrier was tight as for it

 Nick nodded seeing her hand him the bag, and stsrt to go up the ladder.
 He slung her bag onto his shoulder, as it hung. He watched her climb, 
then saw her stop? He raised an eyebrow, then heard what she said. What 
does she mean? Is she catching onto his act? Maybe he should leave with 
her bag while he has a chance and shoot her in the head midair? No. 
Thats not how he works.</p><p class="center italic">✏ he stelped onto 
the ladder then looked back up at her. After she finished talking it was
 silence. Birds chirping and distant screams from afar. "Hah, yeah. 
Youre right. There are shitty poeple out here. You can't really trust 
anyone nowadays. Either they kill you or steal your shit. But trust me, 
im not That kind of guy." Lies lies lies. Everything he says is lies. 
Except from his parents. That he loves talking about. He loves calling 
them weak or psthetic. Cause they we're. His first team of family sucked
 ass and had no chance of surviving anyway. He started climbing after 
her, carefully watching his step.</p><p class="center">╚══════════════ ☁ ═╝</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/8071a12b43f06dedea19146763c0d8f9c31184dar1-522-600v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 a finger along each window picking up dust as she lifted it. It had 
been a long time since she saw a place that just had dust wrong with it.
  Bish moved on to the furniture. The grey couch looked so new besides 
the few scratches and dustiness of 20 years alone. Untouched but 
certainly lived in as per the sleeping bag laying next to the couch. Her
 nails were long and grown; she had no problem picking at the couch 
fabric almost automatically. Some of the windows were gone so Bish found
 the place to be a little chilly as the night air was let in as a friend
 would be. The last thing she noticed was the desk and bookshelf, it 
still had some books still on it. Stopping her impulsive behavior to 
pick at the couch she made her way across the tower.</p><p class="center italic">“
 More than just nice, ” Bish smlied picking up a small child sized book,
 “ Ya know... I've always wanted to teach Charlie how to read. Do you 
mind if I take one? ” the book read ‘ The great Gatsby. ’ A classic but 
an oldie. Wasn't her favorite book she had seen in a highschool.</p><p>Charlie,
 the little boy she carried around, would grow like his mama. Strong in 
the words of literature. Bish thought that it was too early to be 
selling off things like reading in this world. There were lots of things
 she wanted to teach him... How to take care of himself because no one 
else will, how to truly be a good person. He would be just like his 
daddy. Hell, he already kind of looked like him so why not.</p><p>Beginning
 to whine Charlie kicked his little feet. Bish immediately knew what he 
wanted after so long without eating. She went over to the desk 
unstrapping herself then placed him down on the table. He cried and Bish
 worried he would attract unwanted attention.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/f3ee5b2996cde457ce4f91f892aae1cbffcda4b9r1-684-643v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 why they didn't work in the other places they had stayed at. Don't get 
her wrong, she loved Charlie to bits but it was still a baby. Along the 
road she'd met people who would shame her for having a baby with her. 
Like it was her fault... Like he would get her killed. But to Bish 
Charlie wasn't a nuisance to have while living. He was the reason she 
was. After so much sorrow and heartbreak, there's only so much a person 
can take. Having Charlie was like carrying around her innocence in a 
small bundle.</p><p class="center italic">Bish had taken out her bottle 
and opened the can of evaporated milk, “ Char this gon be a different 
but it's alright” she lifted the corners of her mouth to make a dazzling
 smile at the baby. She carefully poured the can in the bottle then 
attached the top. Setting the bottle down she put the sling in the bag 
taking out a blanket. Charlie was really to wrap like a small burrito. 
It was a chubby little baby that liked to be cocooned in wrapping.</p><p class="center italic"> 2/2</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/f3ee5b2996cde457ce4f91f892aae1cbffcda4b9r1-684-643v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 looked at Tobias in distraught, she barely had the courage to survive 
after her parents had disappeared, and Tobias over here had to bury his 
parents at age twelve. This was just absolutely horrible. Not to mention
 seeing your mother's throat be clawed open by your rotting brother. She
 had questions, like how his dad didn't just shoot him, but she didn't 
really think like this was the right moment to do so. So instead she 
comforted em, she hugged him ( although this was like nine years ago he 
probably got over it but lolz who cares) and continued to say</p><p>"I

 was taken aback slightly by the gesture, but he didn't pull away. That 
isn't to say hi reciprocated the hug. He wasn't sure what to do, he 
hadn't had such an embrace with another human for years. "It's fine, I'm
 fine, it was years ago. It doesn't matter anymore. They're dead and 
buried, and I've moved on. It's cool." He gently released himself from 
her embrace and cleared his throat "Let's keep moving."</p><p>When night
 fell Toby looked at the stars. "No rain, we should be fine sleeping 
without a shelter. I'll start a fire." he handed her two canteens for 
water from the river next to them and grabbed a large stone, wood, and 
matches from his messenger bag. He started the fire and started carving 
out a dent in the large stone, to make a bowl, with a hammer he had in 
his backpack. He was taking great care in carving the bowl.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="timestamp">

 “I suppose that is also true. I mean after 26 years of this, I am not 
sure what else to suspect.” Presley would say as she looked over towards
 him, with a suspicious look in her eyes. “Be careful of the glass on 
the floor.” She’d say, showing off her bandaged hand before putting it 
back by her side. She didn’t exactly trust him yet, she wasn’t easy to 
trust by any stretch of the imagination. “I am trying to find a more 
reliable food source….rotten canned foods aren’t….good.” She shook her 
head as she looked around the store, before down at her duffle bag of 
supplies. “I suppose you would be in this situation.” Presley would 
chuckle slightly before going back to the blanked expression that was 
often on her face. It was almost default at this point. “Used to have a 
group...don’t anymore, so by myself is the only option. Plus, I can 
handle myself, you haven’t seen me use this thing.” She would lift the

 anyways, in the dead of night, Tobias would wake up, to the sound of 
crunching leaves and the word "die" repeated. It was him, the charred 
zombie, this time stica was wearing the cloak so the zombie didn't 
acknowledge her. It was standing above Tobias, staring down at him. It 
then crouched down, resting it's hands on the ground, it was now right

him, at least it wasn't not before sniffing the air a bit, and then 
screaming into the air before grabbing Tobias and throwing him into a

 the highest floor in an abandoned building a looming figure was 
observing the city with binoculars. This 20 floors building was serving 
as A.k s hideout. Hardly any zombie goes this high and the building is 
clean from them. The sun was starting to settle on the horizon as he put
 down the binoculars. After shaving as best as he could with his sharp 
knife the beard from a small broken mirror he put on his clothes and his
 black cowboy hat. Always making sure to lock the door behind this 
office he made into his home from rearranging all the furnitures he 
arrives at the broken lift . Because power went out years ago he was 
using the metal cables to grapple down to the ground floor. Carefully 
checking if any zombies were there he deducted the place was clear.</p><p class="italic center">After
 arriving at ground floor and exiting from the back of the building he 
opened the map to check for possible places to raid. Some shops nearby 
should have some cans if they weren't raided by now. He put a black mask
 like a desperado and started heading for the shops, taking all the 
shortcuts and staying out of sight or open roads . It was raining 
slightly so he put bottles of water to fill up at the roof and should be
 full by the time he got back. The streets were filled with dead people 
or eaten. A sight that no longer affected A.k . For him it looked 
natural almost. Adapt or perish like the rest. He had some encounters 
with other people. Some were ok, some were trying to put a bullet in his
 brain, though he always was one step ahead. His calmness at the face of
 danger helped him prevail. Nah it was his ruthlessness and smart 
decisions that helped him survive so far. And he d do anything to remain
 the apex predator.

 walked for a few hours before finally coming across what he thought was
 a town at first but it was much bigger than that in reality. He walked 
over to slumped body against a wall and kicked it gently to see it fall 
over. He had to be sure it was dead. There was a pharmacy not too far 
from him as he could see it from the place he stood. "Please have 
stock..." he whispered with his thick Danish accent seeping through. As 
he got closer however he heard talking. He pulled out his pistol and 
neared the door. He hadn't seen survivors in years. Last ones he did 
see, he shot and killed because they were slowing him down. That was the
 last time he travelled with people. He peered through the window and 
saw that they had found seeds for farming. He had done the whole farming
 thing but it was too stagnant. He needed to be able to keep moving. 
Kaenen decided to wait patiently outside the pharmacy. He didn't want to
 alarm them nor necessarily talk to them.</p><p>He slumped down against 
the wall and pulled a cigarette pack from his bag and tried lighting one
 up but his lighter was nearly empty. He had just enough juice for a

 dusk set and the skies turned a lovely brownish red, beneath the fading
 light of the sky, within a gas station, sat a child. No more then 4ft

was a playground... though the many corpses that littered the station 
would certainly disagree.</p><p class="center">He rumbled and tumbled 
through the store simply picking up tins and cans with no discrimination
 of size nor material. Shoving every last can he could into the fairly 
large back pack that he dragged around with him. This was Shviel, though
 at first most would presume he was a simple child, but looks can 
certainly be deceiving.</p><p class="center">Upon his hip laid a simple 
wooden crossbow, his grey hoody held all sorts of small weaponry, 
whether it be blunt or sharp he used whatever he could to survive. His 
resourcefulness and what could essentially be described as a library of 
information, which was neatly packed into that small skull of his, 
helped him to last this long. Though those who fell victim to his 
rudimentary traps could be credited too.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/af5d3aa1d8d647d20c8f88d4ae6b59e6b60e3547r1-400-400v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

trusting his abilities as a leader. ‘What abilities?’ he thought to 
himself, snickering as he did so.</p><p>“It’s possible they did. Let’s 
run with that, saves me from some emotional baggage.” Of course, it 
wasn’t as easy as that to run from grief and the heavier thoughts within

new perspective on what had happened a month and a bit ago.</p><p>“Maybe

 He didn’t know why, but this was the first time he had actually used 
this title. It had been so generously granted to him by the teammates 
they had just discussed, and had been picked up by others here and 
there. Why he decided to use it right now, he didn’t know. Maybe because
 it was due to the now different perspective he had on the events that 
had transpired, and had decided to attempt to accept every part of his 
past. God knows.</p><p>And with that, he took a few steps backwards before falling into the water, straight on his back.

 Shviel wondered between the shelves, his tiny little grubby hands 
snatching anything of value and swiftly shoving it into his bag. Though 
the sound of a creeping door spurred him to stand alert, he stood still.
 Wondering if it was a wandering Walker or another human being... though
 after a small thought passed through his mind. He immediately presumed 
it was a human. No Walker would simply walk into the door then leave 
immediately. He couldn’t hear any footsteps  though he certainly heard a
 somebody shoving glass away.</p><p class="center">Hiding amongst the 
maze of shelves and fridges he kept low to the ground. His small body 
scattered around the station, his small feet pittering and pattering as 
he attempted to locate this intruder by sound alone though he swiftly 
ceased this foolish attempt, placing his bag down he pulled out a 
extendable pole made of simply plastic, it had a mirror attached to the 
end of it.</p><p class="center">A loud snap could be heard as Shviel 
extended the pole, lifting it upward he looked at the mirror as it 
peeled over the shelves, turning it slowly left to right to see anybody.
 Though he didn’t see much besides from a foot quickly retreating behind
 some cover. With a small huff, Shviel prepared for combat. Whether it 
was necessary or not was neither a question that lingered, nor a 
question that entered within his mind. Picking his crossbow from his hip
 Shviel loaded a metal scrap head bolt into it. It had enough power to 
pierce somebodies skull... though a simple helm can minimise its damage.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/72367adb864d1eef6f330f20d0a33c85a0422ca1r1-1080-1338v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 nodded in response to Savannah "It's no problem, really. People like us
 gotta look out for each other". He leaned back and looked up at the 
stars as well, mentally noting some constellations he recognized. His 
eyes began to feel heavy as he started to feel the effects of sleep 
deprivation. Hearst didn't get good sleep in general because of his 
nightmares, and after that last night with Nick he didn't sleep at all.</p><p>➳
 He looked back to Savannah when she asked about the woods. "As far as 
I've experienced, the woods are usually safer. After the infection hit 
there were more people in the city than in the more rural areas. So, 
less infected." He explained in a straightforward fashion. This had been
 his experience for the most part, and for most of his time alone he'd 
stuck to the rural areas. However there were the rare cases where he'd 
find people who had the same idea as Hearst and lived in the woods as 
well. And sometimes there would be infected lingering nearby. He was 
hoping maybe it was not the case with this forest.</p><p>➳"Would it be 
alright if I stayed the night here?" he asked, quirking a brow at 
Savannah in question. "I could move to a different rooftop, but you have
 a good idea staying up here. It's safer, since we can look out for each
 other while we rest." He shrugged as he offered. He rubbed the back of 
his head and have a small chuckle "and it's been a while since I've 
slept" He elaborated, sounding honest with her. He hoped he might be 
able to stay, but he wouldn't have blamed her if she refused.</p><p>ᗒᗒ┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅➣</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><!----><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/c34bf105e2c44245a421035e2c3a5c0a51255d25r1-2048-2048v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 sighed and ran a hand through his hair, looking over at Stica, barely 
visible by the embers of the fire. He shook his head and moved to the 
fire. This time, though, he sat beside her. He couldn't explain it, but 
he was starting to feel something. It was... Not exactly a fondness of 
her, or a friendship, he couldn't remember the name of this feeling, 
he'd heard it once. He tried not to dwell on it, amd instead looked at 
her face for a while before lighting a new fire and laying down next to 
her.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/2c11c208a784c4074d19c7b5789af83ccf78f2a3r1-512-512v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 damon was just getting back up slowly into a corner by a few clickers 
that he found real scary.. the survivor he originally came looking for 
appeared out of nowhere and damon almost shot his ass because he thought
 it was a rat.. damon felt his hand getting grabbed and he of course 
went along with the stranger because anything was better than being 
stuck with the infected.</p><p class="center italic">damon quickly ran 
behind this other survivor but got tackled by a climber, without even 
properly looking he fired off two shots with his shotgun.. the loud 
shots echoed throughout the building but it did get that climbler off 
him.. damon scrambled to get to his feet and hurried his little ass out 
of there.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/f4457f77ff5d50636fc0f60f1608a1c26e1bbde1r1-320-320v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

around frantically. He sighed, shaking his head, and looked at Stica. It
 seemed he'd forgotten about her momentarily. "Oh, uh, hi." he said,

been exhausted from the shambler incident and the anxiousness of 
retrieving her family photo the same day. “Go ahead and sleep, I’ll stay

could tell an entire life story as they came face to face with death so 
many times they hardly notice it anymore. But now the kid had a dilemma.
 Either shoot him then shoot the walker or shoot the walker and see what

 a finger along each window picking up dust as she lifted it. It had 
been a long time since she saw a place that just had dust wrong with it.
  Bish moved on to the furniture. The grey couch looked so new besides 
the few scratches and dustiness of 20 years alone. Untouched but 
certainly lived in as per the sleeping bag laying next to the couch. Her
 nails were long and grown; she had no problem picking at the couch 
fabric almost automatically. Some of the windows were gone so Bish found
 the place to be a little chilly as the night air was let in as a friend
 would be. The last thing she noticed was the desk and bookshelf, it 
still had some books still on it. Stopping her impulsive behavior to 
pick at the couch she made her way across the tower.</p><p class="center italic">“
 More than just nice, ” Bish smlied picking up a small child sized book,
 “ Ya know... I've always wanted to teach Charlie how to read. Do you 
mind if I take one? ” the book read ‘ The great Gatsby. ’ A classic but 
an oldie. Wasn't her favorite book she had seen in a highschool.</p><p>Charlie,
 the little boy she carried around, would grow like his mama. Strong in 
the words of literature. Bish thought that it was too early to be 
selling off things like reading in this world. There were lots of things
 she wanted to teach him... How to take care of himself because no one 
else will, how to truly be a good person. He would be just like his 
daddy. Hell, he already kind of looked like him so why not.</p><p>Beginning
 to whine Charlie kicked his little feet. Bish immediately knew what he 
wanted after so long without eating. She went over to the desk 
unstrapping herself then placed him down on the table. He cried and Bish
 worried he would attract unwanted attention.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/f3ee5b2996cde457ce4f91f892aae1cbffcda4b9r1-684-643v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

her wrong, she loved Charlie to bits but it was still a baby. Along the 
road she'd met people who would shame her for having a baby with her. 
Like it was her fault... Like he would get her killed. But to Bish 
Charlie wasn't a nuisance to have while living. He was the reason she 
was. After so much sorrow and heartbreak, there's only so much a person 
can take. Having Charlie was like carrying around her innocence in a 
small bundle.</p><p class="center italic">Bish had taken out her bottle 
and opened the can of evaporated milk, “ Char this gon be a different

attached the top. Setting the bottle down she put the sling in the bag

 He watched the female walking around, touching and picking at things. 
He sat on the couch and opened his back, putting his gun into it. He 
grabbed a small mirror and looked at himself. Messy. Dirty. He sighed 
and grabbed a brush that he found once on the floor, and rsn it through 
his messy knotted hair. He hummed a tune as he did so. Shen she asked 
the question, he looked over at her and smiled. "Yeah! I dont mind. Take
 any book youd like." He never really learned to read anyway so he 
doesnt give a shit if she took them all. He learned a few things along 
the way.</p><p class="center italic">✏ When his hair was done being

hair. He put his stuff away then stood up, taking his shoes off. He sat 
back down and grabbed a can of corn from his bag, opening it and pouring
 some into his mouth. "Also, want some?" He asked, offering some corn to
 her. He fluffed uo his hair and rubbed his face, with a small painful 
groan, as he leaned back, pouring some more corn into his mouth.</p><p class="center">╚══════════════ ☁ ═╝</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/9256728594a17ea4f6a10a99e84c6dac0e9f1fafr1-493-647_68.gif" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 sat there. His heart racing as his small crimson eyes stared up at the 
absolutely unit of a man. His words echoed in his mind as he sat there, 
he was unsure of where he had come from nor why he was here. But either 
way he certainly had a choice. A small chuckle came from the pale boy as
 he pulled the crossbow out of his hoody, shoving it under the jaw of 
this... more then intimidating man. And spoke with an oddly confident 
tone. Though his hand was shocking it appeared he was more then ready to
 pull the trigger. Though Shviel didn’t have any spare bolts on him... 
since all of his bolts were in that little back pack of his, he wanted 
to see if he could pull something first.</p><p class="center">“Well, 
whilst I’m not exactly pleased that you’ve seen through my little 
charade here... I must say, you certainly know how to pick your times to
 strike. Too bad you didn’t act on it.”</p><p class="center">Glaring up 
at the man with a small grin creeping upon his face, he cheekily 
exclaimed as he lowered his crossbow. Leaning backwards upon the palms 
of his hands.</p><p class="center">“You have certainly given me a 
choice, but I feel as if you’ve underestimated how spiteful your 
opponent can be. So I can rather shoot the Walker and die by you... 
or... scream until my lungs give out and have us both killed.”</p><p class="center">His
 crimson eyes wondered across the store before landing upon the Walker, 
but with another line his eyes snapped back to the man.</p><p class="center">“So...
 if you want me to do anything, you’re gonna haft to...1. Lift this 
shelf off my leg, 2. Piss off to the back room. And only then will I 
shoot that Walker, or alternatively... you could always just deal with 
it yourself.”</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/c34bf105e2c44245a421035e2c3a5c0a51255d25r1-2048-2048v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

It came abundantly clear... that this man was indeed...</p><p class="center">“No fun at all...”</p><p class="center">Shviel
 grumbled. Raising his crossbow to the Walker, he took a second to 
steady his aim before pulling the trigger. And with a simple snap of the
 string, a scrap head bolt was sent whizzing through the air. Piercing 
the window, and next the walkers head. It’s body dropped to the floor as
 Shviel pulled a small vile from his pocket. A clear liquid that sloshed
 around within the vile, it was... lube? Out of all things why would 
lube be one of the items this small child was carrying, though it’s 
purpose swiftly became clear.</p><p class="center">Pouring it upon his 
trapped foot he wriggled and squirmed until his foot popped out from 
underneath the shelf, standing up he brushed himself off and with 
furrowed brows he spoke.</p><p class="center">“You know... you big stoic
 types really annoy me, you’re never any fun. No jokes nor pokes. Just 
the same old intimidation act, over and over and over... it gets boring 
you know...”</p><p class="center">Shviel didn’t pay much kind to the 
man. He didn’t care at this point, he wasn’t able to do much to him 
psychologically and he doubted his ability to do anything physically 
either. So he just left it up to chance on whether or not he would be 
killed, kneeling down he reached under the shelf, grasping in the dark 
he reached for his bag and started to slowly tug it out from beneath the
 collapsed shelf.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="timestamp">

 listened as he talked about the woods mentally noting everything he 
said. She was never really a person who loved being in the woods 
completely but it did make sense that it would be safer than the city. 
There is more of a chance to find some resources, like food and it is 
also a much bigger area where confrontation has a smaller chance of 
happening which would be a good thing or a bad thing. It gives less 
chances if something bad happened there might not be many people around 
but also less chances of getting killed.</p><p class="center">After 
hearing him ask if he could sleep here she felt a bit hesitant at first.
 She knew he meant no harm in it but of course from past experiences 
things like this still would always make her hesitate. “Yes, of course 
you can sleep here.” She said in a calm voice with a  smile. “I slept 
earlier so I’m not really tired at the moment. I can move back over to 
where I was earlier and if you would like and I could watch out to make 
sure nothing happens tonight if you’re comfortable with it.” She knew it
 could potentially be a risky thing for her but he definitely seemed 
tired, it was one of the first things she noticed about him. She 
wondered if it was just him traveling or if it was something else since 
it seemed like he hadn’t slept in a few days. If anything was going to 
happen to her he seemed like the least person to worry about doing

 groaned childishly, standing to wooble over towards the sleeping area 
in order to let himself drop onto the mattress that he had laid out into
 the center of the space. The thing was covered in a thin plastic sheet 
that crunched a bit when you got onto it, but it was necessary to keep 
the constant moisture and splashing water from affecting it. "Well if 
you're staying watch I'm suuure I will be totally safe." He drawled with
 a chuckle, rolling up into the blankets with a small smirk on his face.</p><p>"I
 swear, you keep mocking me and I'll come over there and unbandage your

 rolled her eyes, amusing to have these back-and-forth comebacks to keep
 her mind busy. “Yeah, yeah- hurry off to dreamland, ‘sleeping beauty’.”
 She chuckled softly, brilliant with the name-calling.</p><p>The 
mentioning of her bandages brought her attention to them, drawing her 
hand close to inspect how it was healing up. “These are MY bandages, 
remember? I took them.” She smirked, glancing to her knuckles once more.
 A small smile developed on her face, thankful she’d found Leander when 
she needed to.</p><p>Her smile slowly dipped down as she was left with 
her own thoughts and the ambience of the surrounding water. Eyes 
shifting back over to Leander’s hunkered down form, she looked 
conflicted. She was getting attached.. wasn’t she-? No, this wasn’t ever
 a good sign. What if something were to happen to him? What if one of 
them ended up bitten? What if-?</p><p>The small bit of a breeze crept 
down her spine, causing Kyo to pull her arms closer around herself. She 
pulled out her jacket, placing it on. Trying to get her mind off of the

 woke after around six hours of sleep, his body already used to this 
rythm.  He stood up from the bed and fixed the sheets, stretching his 
heavy body. Lucky enough it was becoming summer, in the winter he always
 had to halt his travels and get the boat out of the water to save it 
from the freezing lakes and rivers. That was the biggest downside of 
traveling by boat and not on the saltwater areas that would not freeze.</p><p>The brunette combed his hair with a old comb that lacked a few teeth but still worked, untangling it as good as possible.</p><p>"Kyo?
 Where you at?" He called out while pulling his shirt over his head, 
woobling to the back of his ship to dunk his old clothing into the cold 
water, scrubbing any grime off of them with a piece of hard soap.</p><p>His back and chest was littered with scars and healing wounds.</p><p class="center">╰─....🌿.──────────╯</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/f4457f77ff5d50636fc0f60f1608a1c26e1bbde1r1-320-320v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 a hand over your mouth, or something." Toby whispered to her, almost in
 her ear. He started moving forward and looking around trees. When he 
saw the outline of the unmoving mass of rotten flesh, he looked away for
 a moment. "The cloak's probably worn off by now because of the rain. It
 won't work on them." He nodded at Stica and they made a wide arc around
 the Zombie Wall, their shoes getting lightly soaked by the river.  They
 continued walking like this for what seemed like forever before Toby 
stopped for a moment, then stood up. "I think we made it." he said. Just
 as the words came out of his mouth he was tackled by a stray into the 
water. There was much thrashing and struggling but finally, the water 
calmed, and the water turned red. It seemed that Toby had either drowned
 or died when, finally, Toby resurfaced, gasping for air. He came back 
to shore and knelt on the ground, coughing. "Fucker had me pinned when I
 killed him. Those things do NOT float." He groaned and stood up once 
again.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="timestamp">

 told them to stop. "State your business." "I'm a wanderer, this is my

said "Inn." Inside, there was a lady behind the counter. "Ah, Toby!" she
 said "Welcome back. Did you find what you were looking for?" Toby 
nodded "Yeah, got it, but I need a room for the night." "Ah, a room for

 as if you know everything about me. You truly are a pile of scaffolding

walkers head and threw back to Shviel was useless, it’s scrap tip was no
 where to be seen and it’s wooden head, splintered and shattered into a 
million pieces. His bolts were created to shatter within a opponents 
body, so even if he didn’t kill them with the first shot, they would 
still have shrapnel within their body.</p><p class="center"> Watching

 he muttered before pulling out his bag from underneath the collapsed

 up his bag, he pulled out another scrap bolt. Loading it into his 
crossbow, he held his dear weapon close to his chest, as he slinged the 
bag over his shoulder and into his back. Following the man to the back, 
all he wanted was to leave and get back to what he was originally doing,
 though by the looks of things it may be more interesting, and perhaps 
productive... to follow this man instead.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/25c6c51e0864a3ae616ec2e435bc2414f50e3a2fr1-1033-1027v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 Mikey nodded. As he came closer to assist the lady it became clear just
 how short he was. Even so, he was still quite strong, able to support 
most of her weight of need be. "I have a small camp in the woods that we
 can stay at for the night. I don't have medical bandages, but I have 
something better than whatever that is. I can patch you up."</p><p>His 
camp turned out to be a lot farther away than one might think, but he 
had obviously spent a lot of time making sure it was secluded and looked
 nice. There was a few old pillowcases stuffed with leaves for a bed and
 a tarp strung up by two trees to protect it and the small fireplace 
he'd made. "It's not a lot, but it's safe enough. Not a lot of company, 
if you know what I mean." He led her to the small bed "I can get another
 pillowcase of something if you need it to be longer."</p><p>He squatted
 by the fire with a piece of scrap metal and a rock. The rock turned out
 to be flint, and after a couple of minutes he had a small firr going, 
which he fed larger and larger sticks. He didn't exactly have logs, but 
it was something. "Now," he said, digging through his backpack "Lemme

 was just extremely intimidated by the guard, and honestly everyone in 
general. There was just so many people, and usually you'd only see a 
bunch of infected humans, but these people werent infected, but what, 
what of they were? It would be terrifying, and for Stica it definitely 
was terrifying, so many strangers so many people. As they entered the 
strange building she looked around as there wasn't actually anyone in 
there other than the woman behind the counter.</p><p>"Hey uh, Tobias 
what is this? Is it a shop? Wait, is this an actual shop that isn't run 
down and abandoned?" She said because she hasn't ever seen an up and 
working shop before, so this would've been cool, if it were not for the 
fact that this was an Inn, stupid you Stica. And then, she heard the 
word 
"gggggggiiiiiiiirrrrrrrlllllllllllfffffrrrrrrrriiiiiiieeeeeeeeennnnnnnnddddddd"
 she had forgotten what a girlfriend was, but she did remember instantly
 what it meant when she heard it, she was taken aback a bit, all she 
could muster was a feeble "Uh, I-"</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/f7cee5c7ed0311feea7cf0d44989db2ced4dc416r1-159-158v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 didn't go back to sleep, he stayed awake looking out the window. The 
guard at the gate paced back and forth, and in the middle he became 
invisible, not catching in the light of the torches on both sides of the
 gate. Toby simply watched him go from one side, go dark for a moment, 
then appear in the light of the torch, walking to the other side.then he
 did it again. Soon the sun came up, and Toby yawned and stretched. He 
watched Stica for a while, eating some need jerky while he waited for 
her to wake up.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="timestamp">

 Shviel followed the man, twisting and turning through out these damp 
city alleyways, he took note on their location and where they have been.
 So just in case, he could back track to the station, if the need ever 
occurred.</p><p class="center">Though whilst Shviel suspected to stumble
 into a Walker or two, he hadn’t anticipated an entire horde of runners.
 This was most certainly a tricky situation... listening to the man, he 
kneeled down for a second. Placing his fingers upon his little chin he 
sat there and thought for a moment. Pulling his bag from behind him, he 
settled it upon the crack road they sat upon, pulling out a book he 
swiftly flicked through the many pages that filled with oddly large 
book. Landing upon a page, his crimson eyes darted left to right, he was
 reading. Though it didn’t take long before he put away the book and 
pulled out a glass bottle from his bag along with a rope.</p><p class="center">Standing
 up and peeping over this rusted car he glared at the runners, before 
looking around, seeing a shattered open window upon the third floor of a
 building, he sighed. Turning to the man he chuckled a small bit.</p><p class="center">“Well, when faced with something like this. The only thing I’d do here is take a gander...”</p><p class="center">
 stepping back he started to swing the roped glass bottle, he swung it 
until the point it started to make a very soft whistling sound, there 
was a small hole on the bottom of the bottle. Lifting his arm he spread 
two fingers apart and took aim. Launching the glass bottle he aimed for 
the shattered window, hoping it would go inside.</p><p class="center">With
 a moment of silence filling his mind as he let go of the rope, the 
glass bottle whistled through the air... it went surprisingly high, and 
with a moment of tension building in the air, the bottle made it through
 the window and shattered upon impact within the building. The 
shattering of glass echoed through the still air.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/9256728594a17ea4f6a10a99e84c6dac0e9f1fafr1-493-647_68.gif" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

signaled to start crouch walking through the cars staying low and 
passing by the horde. Thunders were frequent but there was no rain and 
this could be good or bad.</p><p>But then as they passed a bit and were 
nearly away from them, A.k s worst fear came to pass but it wasn't what 
he predicted. He didn't even have time to warn the kid he just dropped 
down and stood still like a statue. Hopefully the kid would read the 
situation and act accordingly. Because from a small distance to them a 
noise was heard in a strange rythm that kept getting faster by the 
second.</p><p>Tick</p><p>Tick</p><p>The worst possible foe to have in an

one with the ground and froze . Using echolocation the clickers move by 
sound alone and if just one detects you it's game over immediately. They
 ll alert everyone within half a click radius and there s no chance for 
survival at that point. While they are extremely easy to distract , A.k 
could not risk it as he didn't know how many were surrounding them and 
he had no time to check as they were literally passing by him .</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="timestamp">

 knelt in front of the fire again and looked branches into place to make
 them burn better. Holding out his hands, he looked into the mesmerising
 tongues of combustion with a curiosity and fascination. He looked back 
at the lady for a moment before turning his gaze to the fire "Do you 
have a name, or something? Or should I just call you 'lady?' Of course, 
'lady' is certainly easier to remember but I feel like you should have 
SOME humanity. That's what everyone's clinging to in this era, their 
humanity." he said the last part quietly.</p><p>Digging into his bag, he
 fished out a can. He'd come across a town that was actually 
manufacturing canned food again. "Took yous long enough." he'd said. He 
took a knife and started working to cut the can open. He didn't plan on 
sharing this. He'd worked hard, risked his life for this food. He had to
 brave a jammed highway to get a lost teddy bear. He'd almost died, but 
it'd been worth it. On his way back he'd cleaned it as best he could, as
 a gift, and recieved an extra can. He always seemed to be low on food, 
so extra was nice.</p><p>Usiing his knife, he carefully picked up the 
can by the inner lip and placed it as close to the fire as he dared. "I 
don't suppose YOU have any food on ya?" he asked the lady. People tended
 to complain when hungry, and complaining was annoying.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message info-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="linkblue">

 it more comfortable for Stica, so his t-shirt was flapping in the wind 
as they road. "You know, my clothes are really dirty. We should stop 
somewhere so that we can get them washed, huh?" he glanced back at her.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message info-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="linkblue">

 The bumbling of a car immediately  caused Mikaela's head to jerk back 
and get a good look. What the fuck?He couldn't  comprehend  the broken 
down vehicle  that was slowly  inching along the road in which he stood,
 the asphalt cracked and unsuitable for small vehicles  so it was no 
wonder the car haulted with a loud skirt. It was rough on his ears, 
craning his head while his hands held the gun harshly "Uh, excuse you?" 
stammering up some courage he edged over to the man  who uttered 
gerribish. A blank face appearing as the door of the car broke off the 
steel hinges and clashed into the ground. Was this man trying to attract
 a hoard, observing  as the male went to throw the bottle. He bolted 
snatching it from mid air and pulling the alcohol glass bottle to his 
chest before it could shatter.</p><p class="center">" What the fuck are 
you doing!? you're  going to attract a hoard you fuckin swine"

 Immediately  just from  examining the taller male, bias opinions were 
made. They were absolutely rude and obnoxious. Such repulsive nature 
made Mika feel threatened, the bottle ripped from his hands and the 
insults  that came along with it was the the last straw for him. 
Normally he was very sweet hearted to his peers but he wasn't  going to 
stand being shouted at, bawling his fist he clashed a punch aiming for 
the mans face which happened to be quite hard to dodge if manageable.</p><p class="center">"How
 dare you pull up and cause a ruckus" narrowing down  his blue petal 
eyes he growled out  like a rabid little animal. He was ready to beat

 The opposing thoughts began invading  his mind the moment his hand was 
caught from mid air. He didn't  expect  the male who seemed so fickle to
 catch his fist. There was quite a gap in their height as well, Mika was
 only 5'3 and this man towered like a building in comparison. His hand 
pushing  forward til the click of a loaded gun was pushed against his 
head, sweat like bullets streak his face. Now surrending his hand to 
pull back upon it being released, his eyes shut momentarily to ponder 
while the hair breezed skimming his blondr hair into an unruly mess. "I 
don't  give my name to drunkin maniacs" scuffing he fanned his hand 
against his face calming himself. He was holding his own loaded shot gun
 in his left in which he hadn't risen once. Mika refused to kill anyone 
even with reason. "I forgive your intruding on my 'territory'" 
snickering uproared from the small male as he lifted his face with a 
curled grin along his lips, shinning his pearly whites.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/f3ee5b2996cde457ce4f91f892aae1cbffcda4b9r1-684-643v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 glared at the man, confusion filled the child’s mind as he was handed a
 compass. Questions started to enter his mind, was this man stupid or 
what? What was he thinking? Though before Shviel could do anything he 
looked up only to read his lips. Shviels brows furrowed even more, he 
barley knew this man yet he was already sacrificing his life for him? 
Shviel couldn’t for the life of him understand his motivations but he 
wouldn’t be given enough time to anyways.</p><p class="center">As the 
glass shattered and that ear piercing screech was let off he heard it...
 the rumbling of a horde. With no thought he held the compass close, to 
his chest before dashing. Running as fast as his little legs could carry
 him, he turned his head to look behind him... he had an odd sense of 
guilt fill his heart... as he watched A.K get swarmed he hoped that he 
had a plan, but judging from this sudden rush... he presumed he didn’t. 
Shaking his tiny head he continued.</p><p class="center">A voice pierced his mind as he ran</p><p class="center">’Run,
 Run, Run little man... the end times have come yet your bed time is

the muddy riverside. Well, at least he had enough water now. That was 
something.</p><p>A run-down building at the very edge of the river

 of his obsession. It was a cynical thought, and deep down in the back 
of his mind he knew it was wrong, but what are memories and thoughts 
for, if not to explore every possible outcome of a previous situation? 
It was a fun mental exercise to bend a situation in all possible 
directions, even the most cynical and unrealistic ones.</p><p>Slinging

 damon has returned to his car park and was standing ontop of the 
building just looking down at the ruined city.. he had a lot of urges to
 end it all lately.. it seemed like there was no hope for anyone anymore
 and when there was.. it wasn't for him, he wasn't rich, not that money 
meant anything.. but, he didn't have family somewhere.. not that he knew
 off at least.. damon had seen some horrifying stuff and it was getting 
to a point where any human interaction felt like therapy.. even with 
that nutcase from earlier today, looking into the distance he saw thick 
dark clouds forming..</p><p class="center italic"> a storm was rising.. 
bad weather was one or the worst things that could happen, he was happy 
he had the car park mainly to himself so he had some save shelter to sit
 in.. but in the beginning when his parents first passed away and the 
storm then.. he barely made it out, the cold rain hitting against his 
face reminded him of those few days.. horrible.. horrible..</p><p class="center italic">
 after watching the clouds for a bit longer he went back downstairs to 
the second floor, his floor.. he got inside his van and laid ontop of 
the old and worn out mattress, damon looked at his record player and sat
 up again.. he grabbed his favourite record and wiped some dirt off it 
when taking it out it's case.. damon put the record in the player and 
lowered the arm of the player.. he turned up the sound a bit higher and 
relaxed as a familiar song came rolling out the player..</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/25c6c51e0864a3ae616ec2e435bc2414f50e3a2fr1-1033-1027v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

stalkers are ten times harder to kill because of their mobility and 
aggressive attacks.</p><p>Thankfully though there were a bunch of

 and misfortune did not actually exist, but people tend to cling to the 
most unbelievable things when the world is ending. There were many 
better justifications as to why leaving was a good choice, like the fact
 that they were complete strangers, but it seems he stuck with this one.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/00630979e6de76e729fff12979acaedae7e56936r1-500-500v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 The croaking of an unexpected guessed luring from behind made his brows
 furrow into a frown. He held a pickaxe he found in a random backyard. 
Though to get it , ye had to make a sacrifice. The blood of his hand was
 , humane and dry but that's not worth paying attention to right now. He

he could really use a shower. Too much blood. The male walked to the 
closest place to where he camped for the night. It was a convenience 
store that coincidentally had a parking lot. As most do. Inside , he 
found a half full water jug. It looked fine , but he examined closer to 
make sure he's not putting himself at some type of risk. It was cold out
 and having a bloodied shirt was simply uncomfortable. Taking the jug 
and his belongings , i wanted to move again. A storm was coming soon ,

 Miguel stood in the parking lot. Where a good amount of abandon cars 
sat. He wasn't stupid. In short , he tried a few to see if they'd drive.
 Whilst checking, he went up to a van that seemed pretty...workable. He 
reached to open the door , stopping when his eyes felt on Damon. It 
sparked a blank look , as he tried to look at the back the car without 
disturbing him. Even so , he didn't care , he needed to go home whether-</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/3f43bb9b6414bfbd48e5620a906270350cdd35e5r1-736-736v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 He had left the girl who had found him  he didn't want her to die. He 
had to leave, he was to scared to be there, he was scared that she would
 die if he stayed. So he just left. Walking away, and looking for a

 glanced outside and began to become increasingly anxious. It had to be 
at least around 10-11 by now. Didn’t Leander say he’d be back soon..? 
The fidgety girl pulled at her jacket’s sleeve strings. Noticing the 
wind was beginning to pick up, a storm was bound to start soon. You know
 what? Fuck it. She was going to look for him.</p><p>Grabbing a slip of 
paper just before she’d head off, she wrote down where she’d be looking 
for Leander (city district) and what time she assumed it was now.</p><p>Grabbing
 her pack, she heaved it over her shoulders and brushed her hair out of 
her face. Making sure the anchor was still present on the houseboat, she
 did her best to cover it up with messy branches the same way she’d 
taken them down a day or so ago. Heading off into the city, she hoped 
she’d find him pretty soon.</p><p>She passed familiar buildings, 
landmarks in her own mind. Where there was bound to be zombies, there 
was bound to be Leander. Her attention targeted what seemed to be a 
small group of undead wandering near the back alleys of the streets.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/3f43bb9b6414bfbd48e5620a906270350cdd35e5r1-736-736v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 The croaking of an unexpected guessed luring from behind made his brows
 furrow into a frown. He held a pickaxe he found in a random backyard. 
Though to get it , ye had to make a sacrifice. The blood of his hand was
 , humane and dry but that's not worth paying attention to right now. He
 didn't have a firearm to just...blow it's head off. Which he didn't 
mind but it was really risky to get close. His decision was final.</p><p class="italic center">

expression relaxing as he gripped his ' weapon ' tighter. Miguel began 
walking , at a normal pace until he was a the perfect distance , it 
lunged at him. Without a another second , he acted. To say the least , 
he could really use a shower. Too much blood. The male walked to the 
closest place to where he camped for the night. It was a convenience 
store that coincidentally had a parking lot. As most do. Inside , he 
found a half full water jug. It looked fine , but he examined closer to 
make sure he's not putting himself at some type of risk. It was cold out
 and having a bloodied shirt was simply uncomfortable. Taking the jug 
and his belongings , i wanted to move again. A storm was coming soon , 
he was left to stock up on food and such. He had gotten all the supplies
 and shit he need , there was just one minor inconvenience. It was like 
an hour away. He swore to himself not to walk on foot.</p><p class="italic center">
 Miguel stood in the parking lot. Where a good amount of abandon cars 
sat. He wasn't stupid. In short , he tried a few to see if they'd drive.
 Whilst checking, he went up to a van that seemed pretty...workable. He 
reached to open the door , stopping when his eyes felt on Damon. It 
sparked a blank look , as he tried to look at the back the car without 
disturbing him. Even so , he didn't care , he needed to go home whether-</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/3f43bb9b6414bfbd48e5620a906270350cdd35e5r1-736-736v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

paper , shotgun in hand. Miguel had looked off to the side , not 
purposefully but i looked like it was. Not reading the note at all , he 
walk to the back of the van. He noted that there was a possibility that 
the van Damon was in couldn't move , resulting in him knocking on the 
window to ask being pointless. Instead he'd set his thoughts on one 
particular car that had a missing wheel with everything else intact , 
which was really damn lucky in his case. He opened the trunk of the van ,

 followed behind her at a loose jog, as his legs were shorter than hers.
 The thought made him a little bit mad but he tried to subdue his 
emotions. They had a mission, and he planned to see it through to the 
end. He didn't know this other girl, but he wasn't a complete monster. 
He could at least help to find her, if she was alive, if she wasn't 
reanimated.</p><p>The city was much quieter now, and Michael didn't like
 that. "Maybe we shouldn't be out in the open like this?" he suggested 
uneasily, still following Darcy, but he was now more or less beside her,
 turning when she turned and slowing down when she slowed down. He was a
 bit like a dog, really, in the way he followed her. She had told him to
 do it, though, and she couldn't blame him for the way he completed 
these actions. "Yeah, we should really get off the street before 
something bad happens. I feel like I can hear them breathing. Do zombies
 even breath? I've never seen their breath innthe air during the winter,
 and doesn't that happen when you breath? Even so, they do growl and 
scream. Jesus, Zombies are frickin terrifying."</p><p>As they walked he 
suddenly extended his baton and held it out in front of him, facing a 
nearly demolished building. "I know I'm kind of paranoid right now, but I

 wrap its boney,  moldy arms around Leander face. The metal pipe crashed
 into the creatures head, splitting it open and allowing nasty smelling 
rotten goo that had probably once been its brain, to seep out. He 
slammed the weapon into the creatures face a few more times for good

 stood up on the rooftop of a slightly decaying building, her light blue
 eyes studying her surroundings carefully. Always take the high ground..
 that’s what her Aunt always had told her. It’s a lot harder for the

farther and plan out where you’re going.</p><p class="center italic">The

 if they were hostile, infected, or even a thief. She had to be careful.</p><p class="center italic">”Uh....

 The small male had his katana in hand, as he quitely walked down a 
road, watching his feet, but he was listening to wear he was. He didn't 
want to be attack by zombies, or people that wanted what little supplies
 he had. But as he walked, his feet seemed to barley hit the ground, 
since they were so quite, as he walk towards a gas station. He was being
 dead silent, almost dead like, probably not the best idea, but that's 
okay, he was gonna be fine. He walked in and softly closed the doors 
behind him, so that nothing would get attracted to the building. He 
searched the place, for zombies, and people, he knew it probably wasn't 
the best idea, but it was okay. When finding pretty much nothing, other 
than the body of a person who must have worked there in the past. So he 
just made sure to lock the door of the closet which the body was in, 
just in case, he didn't want anything to happen, or to be attacked. he 
realxed, and sighed as he leaned against the counter, taking a minute or
 two, before he started looking for any food. he was quite hungry, and 
hadn't seen anyone for months, so he was also lonely. But he didn't 
mind, he was afraid if someone got to attached, or close to him they'd 
die, or get bit, like he had been once. He looked at his arm, just had 
bandages on it from when he nicked himself with his katana several times
 while practicing. But he didn't care about that now. he just walked and
 soon bumped into a shelf, which had a can of BEANS. He smiled and 
grabbed it, before walking over to the cash register. He looked around 
and saw a lighter, he lit it up, and moved it under the can. So it could
 Cook, he was starving, so he would eat the BEANS, even if he didn't 
like them. He was just hungry, so this was close enough. He just waited,
 hoping nothing and no one tried to walk in and steal it, while he 
cooked the can of BEANS</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/9a8f8190104329b2e668dcb588ea5334db3539b9r1-828-697v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 it's a human," Mikey said "they could potentially disarm you. I'll go 
check it out, it could be your friend." He sounded nervous, but he 
started toward the wreckage, ducking behind some cover. "Just cover me."
 he said. He spun around the concrete pot holding a very overgrown 
plant, dying from lack of space to grow it's roots. He hid behind a 
mailbox. A quick dash and he'd be there.</p><p>He looked back at Darcy, 
and then back at the wreckage. Reaching into his pocket, he retrieved a 
coin. He held it up so Darcy could see, then whipped it at the ground. 
It made a loud ringing sound as it bounced off the concrete road and a 
nearby wall. If it was an infected, it would be drawn to the noise. 
Mikey held his breath. Two seconds... Three... Four... He had begun to 
think it was a human when suddenly a form stumbled out of the wreckage 
and stood in the street, looking around.</p><p>Mikey jumped out from his
 cover and spun his baton. As he expected, the infected noticed him. 
Mikey took a breath "You got this." He ran at the infected and dropped 
into a slide at the last second. Throwing a kick at its knees, it 
crumpled and tripped over him. Mikey rolled out of the way and raised 
his baton. With a sickening crunch he brought it down on the infected's 
skull. A few more hits and there was a nice dent in the skull. Mikey 
drew his knife and rammed the blade through this dent. "God, that takes 
so much outta you."</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/9256728594a17ea4f6a10a99e84c6dac0e9f1fafr1-493-647_68.gif" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

finished with his own shirt amd started working on the jeans. He turned 
away from Stica slightly so that he didn't accidentally see anything. It

been homeschooled. However, he'd also been taught the viewing of 
another's nude body without permission was considered rude, and just

 she got up off of her knees and rushed over to Leander. The poor girl 
honestly couldn’t see over the amount of tears trailing down her face. 
Her arms found themselves wrapped around his shoulders in a tight hug 
she didn’t ever want to let go of.</p><p>Her voice came off muffled, 
buried in the fabric of his shirt. “You can’t leave me like this. 
Please,” she choked out a sob, “I can’t lose you!” The heartbreaking 
reality of this world was too much of a burden to continue to go 
through. Life’s twisted sense of humor didn’t pity any worn out girl 
seeking the slightest bit of comfort in a newfound brother.</p><p>Her 
words wouldn’t form behind her cries, trying her damn hardest to cuss 
him out, plead him to stay, beg the absolute heavens to spare just this 
single moment and play back the time.</p><p>She wanted to go back to the
 houseboat, both of them completely fine, talking about the stories 
they’d already written in their memories and those that have yet to be 
blotched in ink. She wanted to sit around a fire and huddle under a 
blanket keeping out the night’s chill, making up scary stories and 
laughing at each other because they couldn’t take one another seriously.
 She wanted to be thrown into the river and taught how to swim all while
 Leander can’t help but burst into laughter at her mock attempts of a 
paddle.</p><p>And yet, those far away wishes vanished. She couldn’t have
 any of that, of course. Why would she ever be allowed a small haven of 
time? The harsh reality was just as it appeared; the two sitting in a 
dirty alleyway, limited with time. Kyo’s words were hardly audible 
anymore, but she spoke through the lump in her throat.</p><p class="italic">“Please, stay.”</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/54d5479bdb122806c8de7ad7e7b66fd3b9099f15r1-2048-2048v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 Axe was setting up base in the bathroom of an old gas station. Although
 the food had mostly ran out by now most of the canned goods and drinks 
could still be used. She heard a familiar jingle as the front door had 
been opened. The undead haven't been in this part of town for a few 
weeks, but that doesn't mean they couldn't have come back. She held onto
 her gun. A hunting rifle her father gave her before they were killed 
off by the virus. She slowly opened the door. She made sure to oil the 
hinges often so it hardly made a sound. She scanned the area. Slowly 
walking to the fridge she hid in there. She looked around passed the 
drinks, and saw a blonde woman near the front. She scanned the woman for
 weapons. None that she could see. She held her gun close, and left the 
fridge. She walked to a small display case of chips, and knocked it over
 making a loud crash. She ran back to her fridge to get a full view of 
the woman for any weapons.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/54d5479bdb122806c8de7ad7e7b66fd3b9099f15r1-2048-2048v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

shorter girl tightly and squeezing her as if that would bring her any 
comfort.</p><p>His face was buried down into her slightly messy hair, 
his sweater slowly growing soaked with her tears as he tried to control 
his breathing. His arm hurt so much that it was difficult to bare, the

 anything. But I'm losing a lot of blood.. I can't stitch it shut

that caused the old wounds on his back and chest to pulse mutely, a 
reminder of how much each single one of them had hurt.</p><p>"I..didn't

 didn't look at her any more, instead he had a snack from his bag while 
he waited for his clothes to dry. "You know, we can get you an extra set
 of clothes?" Toby suggested, glancing at her with a shrug. He figured

instantly sat up to the yelling, whipping out her pocketknife 
instinctively and holding it out at an angle. Ready to slice at whoever 
dared to try and attack them. Her vision was blurry and she was half 
asleep, but awake enough. She grabbed for Mika’s shoulder, hoping to 
help protect him, but his body was no longer there. Sam’s body turned to
 Jaxson, who was the cause of the screams. Nobody and nothing was there 
to attack them, so she set the knife back into where she hid it on her 
belt. The only problems was, what was up with Jax and where did Mika go?</p><p class="center italic">
 She realized that she was moved from her original sleeping post. Now in
 one of the beds, and Mika was most likely in the other at some point. 
Samara hopped up and moved over to Jaxson, knowing he needed better 
comfort, and she would worry about Mika second. The kid could definitely
 take care of himself, but she still worried since he was gone so 
quietly. The female sat down beside the Priest and wrapped her arms 
around him. She wasn’t a hugger by any means, but she figured he needed 
some form of comfort since words weren’t her strong point either. “I’m 
not sure what happened, but it’s okay, Jax. I promise.”</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="timestamp">

 Axel watched as the girl pulled out her gun. Assuming the girl was no 
threat to her. She held her DXL around her shoulders, and slowly exited 
the freezer. Slamming the door behind her, and running behind the cash 
register. She ducked down. As her reputation of being a shadow was she 
stayed in the dark as her outfit helped her blend in. She held her gun 
to her chest. Her knees propped up with her gun pointed at the blonde. 
She kept her breath low as to not make a sound. Looking into a flash of 
light hit the ground along with thunder. The light briefly illuminated 
Axe's face as her eyes narrowed, and her hands gripped the trigger ready
 to pull at any time.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message info-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="linkblue">

Noticing the shotgun , with that he prepared himself to be shot to say 
the least. His expression held seriousness coated in an emotionless

anymore pain than he was experiencing with the pierce of the needle.</p><p>Finishing
 up within a few minutes, it was pretty well done. Not on the status of 
one for a doctor or nurse but a decent stitch up. One of the books she’d
 carried in her pack belonged to a college focused on the study of 
medical necessities.</p><p>Placing everything aside to be sanitized for 
future uses, she let Leander get himself arranged on the bed, hoping 
he’d sleep from the exhaustion of today.</p><p>For now, she wanted to 
make a fire and get a meal prepped before he’d wake up so he could gain 
his energy back. Taking along his bow and arrows while leaving her 
sidearm for him to use, she quietly went downstairs and hopped off the 
boat to hunt nearby.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><!----><li class="timestamp">

matter the age, size or difference between Sam and another person she 
had a connection with, she would protect them until the end. Jaxson may 
be older than her by a couple years, but she was going to protect him 
just like how she would would with Mika. Sam would do all in her power 
to help and save her friends, no matter the cost. It was something she 
strongly stood by. “Don’t say sorry, I felt uneven in my sleep anyway so
 it didn’t bug me. Just surprised me, is all.” Sam lightly shrugged.</p><p class="center italic">
 When he explained where assumed Mika went, that made more sense. She 
was sure he was fine by the time she stood up and followed Jax towards 
the bathroom. Stopping at the microwave, Sam found that his portion of

 his shotgun with him. It made her feel more at ease with him being 
gone. “Let’s try and find him, and then maybe go on our finishing trip? I
 think he might like trying fishing, since I’m pretty sure he hasn’t 
before.”</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/0f9073333ae4e8064101b90b4d05adc40a2fd2c5r1-1200-675v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 nodded and grinned back. "Thanks. I know it's probably not the easiest 
to trust a stranger, but I really appreciate it" His gaze was kindly, 
even though it was easy to see the bags under his eyes from exhaustion. 
"And no don't feel like you have to move anywhere, after all this was 
your roof first. I'll go back to where I was sitting to give you some 
space" He offered. He didn't feel like he needed to move for his safety,
 she seemed trustworthy and kind. But he moreso wanted to make her feel 
more comfortable by not intruding on her space.</p><p>➳He stood up and 
walked back to where he was sitting on the roof earlier before he met 
Savannah. "Goodnight" he bid adieu with a smile as he walked away. When 
he got to his spot on the roof, he dug through the bottom of his pack to
 find his sleeping bag. Hearst rummaged through parts of traps he'd 
made, medical kits and various knick-knacks. He pulled out a large 
sleeping bag and unfolded it onto the ground, and set his pack next to 
it.</p><p>➳He curled up in the sleeping bag, feeling safe for the first 
time in a while. The first time in a while, for the exception when he 
became comfortable around Nick. He buried the thought quickly.</p><p>He 
gazed up at the stars, watching them glitter and twinkle in the black 
void of the night sky. He whispered another quiet goodnight, only loud 
enough for him to hear. He often would talk to his family even if they 
were gone, and it was routine for him to say goodnight to them as well. 
In minutes he was out cold, finally getting some well needed rest.</p><p>ᗒᗒ┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅➣</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/9256728594a17ea4f6a10a99e84c6dac0e9f1fafr1-493-647_68.gif" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 that quickly either since most people don’t for awhile. It felt nice 
knowing that she had someone who she can trust. She watched as he got 
out his sleeping bag.</p><p class="center">When he was asleep she laid 
down on her blanket she had. She pulled out an older book from one of 
her bags and started reading it. She normally didn’t like reading but 
ever since the apocalypse started there really isn’t much else you can 
do. She would pick up random books she found at places, keeping a 
collection to read some of the books each night. It was more a way to 
keep her relaxed whenever she was awake at night.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/6e360942f546e60ac0df54d1fd204a1cc298320cr1-512-288v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 had managed to sleep a solid few hours, not moving or waking for 
anything. If someone were to look at him now, they might have mistaken 
him for a dead man they way he laid so still. This had been the first 
time he'd slept in 3 days, which he was no stranger too but he was 
nonetheless drained.</p><p>➳He began to stir in his sleeping bag as the 
sun rose over the horizon, painting the sky a light orange. He twisted 
and turned in his sleep, muttering to himself in a panicked tone. "N-no,
 no. I can't-" he mumbled in his sleep. Something spooked him as he 
slept and he lurched into a sitting position in his sleeping bag, wide 
eyed and breathing heavily. When he was able to take a look around, he 
remembered quickly where he was and calmed down.</p><p>➳ 'It was just 
another dream' he mentally sighed as he tried to console himself. The 
horrified look on his face and the way he looked so upset when he woke 
up, it was nothing like the unbothered and laid back behavior he 
normally branded.</p><p>➳ He looked over to Savannah, seeing if she had 
woken up yet. He hoped he didn't wake her up, or startle her even. He 
was on the opposite side of the roof so it was unlikely she might have 
heard him, but then again he wasn't aware of how loud he was or that he 
had been talking in his sleep before he woke up. The nightmares were 
common for him, and he never spoke about it. He could normally brush 
them off and go back to his normal chipper attitude, but this one was 
tougher on him. He brushed some golden stray hairs out of his face and 
wiped the sweat from his brow. He tried to force a smile, attempting to 
ignore the nightmare he just had to move on with his day.</p><p>ᗒᗒ┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅┅➣</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/0f9073333ae4e8064101b90b4d05adc40a2fd2c5r1-1200-675v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 wiped his forehead and nodded, holstering his knife and jogging to 
catch up with Darcy. "You really think she's still out here?" he asked 
"You don't think she ran away? Or started trying to find YOU? Or dead?" 
he shrugged "Just saying, there was fire, and infected. I mean, it's a 
miracle YOU survived that. The chances of both of you making it? I doubt
 it." he peered around as they walked. It had become quieter. Mikey knew
 infected didn't like rain, he'd never known why though. It didn't 
affect them much, aside from weighing some of the weaker ones down. 
Mikey had seen some of them facedown in the rain because it made them 
just too heavy.</p><p>After some more walking, and looking in a couple 
of empty buildings, Mikey was on his toes. "She's probably run off 
somewhere." he said. "Come on..." He looked into a building and

building. Even while jogging he was pretty speedy. "Hey, come check this
 out." he said, looking back at Darcy. He had his baton extended but he

 Toby said, snuggling up closer to the tree just to piss her off. He 
closed his eyes again and feel into the realm of unconsciousness. When 
he woke up again, he found that his head was resting on Stica's 
shoulder. He felt his face heat up amd quickly moved away from her 
before she woke up, sitting on the wagon that was too small for him. He 
looked out at the road they had come from and then back at Stica. He ran

hey- Good morning" He forced a grin, but he still looked a bit stressed.
 "I'm alright, I just had a bad dream is all" he tried to play it off as
 something minor, as  nothing to worry about. Which normally he 
wouldn't, but this dream was worse than the others he had. He wondered 
if it had anything to do with meeting Nick just the days prior. Well, it
 wouldn't do him any good to dwell on it, besides he had things to do 
and places to be today. There weren't any room for distractions.</p><p>➳
 He gave Savannah a gentle grin as he stood and stretched, groaning at

knife, still smiling, he laughed again. "Also, don't mind me laughing, 
keeps me sane, y'know, totally not insane already" Jerome laughed again,
 walking closer to Hoshu.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/0f9073333ae4e8064101b90b4d05adc40a2fd2c5r1-1200-675v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 The small male had his katana in hand, as he quitely walked down a 
road, watching his feet, but he was listening to wear he was. He didn't 
want to be attack by zombies, or people that wanted what little supplies
 he had. But as he walked, his feet seemed to barley hit the ground, 
since they were so quite, as he walk towards a gas station. He was being
 dead silent, almost dead like, probably not the best idea, but that's 
okay, he was gonna be fine. He walked in and softly closed the doors 
behind him, so that nothing would get attracted to the building. He 
searched the place, for zombies, and people, he knew it probably wasn't 
the best idea, but it was okay. When finding pretty much nothing, other 
than the body of a person who must have worked there in the past. So he 
just made sure to lock the door of the closet which the body was in, 
just in case, he didn't want anything to happen, or to be attacked. he 
realxed, and sighed as he leaned against the counter, taking a minute or
 two, before he started looking for any food. he was quite hungry, and 
hadn't seen anyone for months, so he was also lonely. But he didn't 
mind, he was afraid if someone got to attached, or close to him they'd 
die, or get bit, like he had been once. He looked at his arm, just had 
bandages on it from when he nicked himself with his katana several times
 while practicing. But he didn't care about that now. he just walked and
 soon bumped into a shelf, which had a can of BEANS. He smiled and 
grabbed it, before walking over to the cash register. He looked around 
and saw a lighter, he lit it up, and moved it under the can. So it could
 Cook, he was starving, so he would eat the BEANS, even if he didn't 
like them. He was just hungry, so this was close enough. He just waited,
 hoping nothing and no one tried to walk in and steal it, while he 
cooked the can of BEANS</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/0f9073333ae4e8064101b90b4d05adc40a2fd2c5r1-1200-675v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 out his combat knife. "Taking you in is potentially a liability...But I
 will. If you try anything funny things wont be pretty,I assure you that
 sir." Hoshu would put his combat knife away and open the door from a

 go insane." Hoshu let go of his arm and put his knife in his pocket. "I
 understand that im paranoid,Its outrageous sometimes but its best to 
stay alive." While hoshu didnt exactly like his current condition,he 
planned in surviving. But....does surviving like this necessarily mean 
he's gonna live a nice life? Obviously no. "...Fine. Ill consider you a

 hadn’t slept the rest of the night but she felt fine. She sat near the 
corner, her knees huddled up to her chin as she watched Blaise get 
absolutely mauled by Ario. Nothing out of the usual for her. Just 
yelling. Her eyes looks over to the window and focused on the sound of 
rain splattering against the window instead of the noise inside. After a
 while, things quieted down and she was woken from her thoughts when 
Ario started to speak again.</p><p class="center">The female turned her 
head to the male, still huddled together, but nodded. She watches Blaise
 get blankets and such near to the kitchen and then fixed her posture to

 don’t believe a wall will be necessary, as we will most likely leave 
this place soon. The materials will be wasted as well, when we could

 reached into his pocket and withdrew some matches. "One sec." he said. 
He lit a match, and closed his eyes for a moment. His lips made subtle 
movements as though he were talking, but no sounds left his lips. When 
the match burned to his fingertips he tossed it on the body and watched 
as is was set aflame. He covered his mouth and nose as he left the

We should quit wasting time over here." He was looking off in the

The next thing he knew, the ground was rumbling and the building was 
falling. "Oh, shit." he said, shielding his face from the rain that had 
practically started moving sideways. "Uhh, maybe we should get moving

 Axel looked at the girl. She let out a soft sigh of pity, and made her 
some hot chocolate. Food was pretty rare these days for people who 
didn't know how to cook. She held onto her gun, and hooked her hand gun 
into a thigh piece connected to her shorts. She pulled up her hair back 
into a tight bun. The two of them sat in the dark. Axe's figure could be
 seen, but her features were harder to spot. She was very fit. Her waist
 was small, and had an hour glass shape. Her emerald green eyes 
flickered in the moonlight as the black card stock paper began to peel  
and rip off the windows.</p><p class="center"> " You still should have

 was rumbling around the cabinets "Hold in there sir!"He shout as he 
looked around for some painkillers and analgesics."C'mon. C'mon where is
 it?"He mumbled. The boy was not much than 15. Quite tall, dark-brown 
hair. Ripped jeans and a hoodie with a vest on top. He had a 5mm pistol 
in his jeans and a rifle. Honestly speaking, the rifle wasn't his. It 
was the man's he was with. After he founded what he needed, he rushed 
back where a man in his late 30's early 40's was laid in a bed "Have you
 found them lad?"The captain asked. Jung nodded "Yeah. Stop being a 
drama queen. You leg is not broken. You must of stepped wrong. "He 
chuckled. The man rolled his eyes but couldn't actually be mad on the 
kid. He took the painkillers while Jung put the creme over "There you go
 sir." He looked up as he heard some hissing. "We have to move soon sir.
 This things will come around like termites"the boy admitted. The 
captain sat up and nodded "You're right. We should move and try to find a
 shelter soon" he spoke. He took his cap and put it on the boy's head. 
Jung rolled his eyes "I'm not leaving you behind okay? Thats not going 
to happen anytime soon" he said. He put the cap back on the man's head, 
and helped him up. He put his arm around his shoulders "Lean on me 
alright?"He said "I'll slow you down" said the captain. Jung shook his 
head "Is alright."He smirked. He started to walk slowly, one hand 
holding the captain's and the other holding his pistol. The captain 
could not put pressure on his left leg so he was limping, dragging his 
leg and trying to be as fast as possible. But, not that was the problem.
 But the stairs. Thoes will take a lot of time for sure.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="chat-message user-message"><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="message-author cover-img"><img src="main-chat-window_data/54d5479bdb122806c8de7ad7e7b66fd3b9099f15r1-2048-2048v2_68.jpg" class="avatar"></a> <div class="message-body"><p class="author-name">

 breathing was heavy but had regained some of its rythm, dried blood 
smeared on his arm where the bite wound had been bandaged up tightly. 
His so typically tanned and freckled skin was now quite a bit more pale 
in comparison, likely due to the amounts of blood he had lost, his wavy 
hair fanned out messily beneath him.</p><p>Despite his rather..mangled 
appearance, the brunettes eyes suddenly snapped open and he grabbed onto
 the empty water bottle on his nightstand and chucked it at the other 
Males forehead, not with full power since he didn't have that currently,
 but still hard enough to do an Ouchy.</p><p>"Get- off my boat!" He ordered, struggling to keep himself upright as he tried to stay sitting.</p><p>Maybe
 threatening was not the best approach in his current state, but being

 older gentleman would be sitting in some half condemned wooden house, 
picking through some kitchen drawers. He had left the city and entered 
the more mountainous areas to avoid larger groups of the infected, not 
particularly keen on fighting them in the downpour that is outside. He 
had his jacket on, his plate carrier over it. His faded NYPD patch sat 
on shoulder, a mark of an era where you didn’t cower in fear of some 
cannibal infections; where you were secure, living a life that most were
 taking for granted, soon swept away from those, leaving the aftermath 
in its wake and killing off most of the planet. Now all that’s left are 
nomads, survivors, and hunters. Rex walls out of the kitchen, his 
leather hat stopping the rain from falling on his face, walking towards 
the garage, seeing a door on the side. He tests the handle, locked; he 
would look around to see if anybody was to be seen before kicking in the
 door. People out this far tended to have guns and other useful 
supplies. He would enter and look around the place to see if any guns, 
ammo, or any supplies were visible.</p></div> <div class="action-show-menu bottom-end"><i class="amino-icon amino-icon-splat"></i> <!----> </div></div></div></li><li class="timestamp">

 reached into his pocket and withdrew some matches and a lighter. "One 
sec." he said. He lit a match, and closed his eyes for a moment. His 
lips made subtle movements as though he were talking, but no sounds left
 his lips. When the match burned to his fingertips he took the lid off 
of the lighter, with some effort and teeth, dumped the fluid on the 
body, then tossed the match on top and watched as the motionless form

building that had stopped smoking in the rain. The next thing he knew, 
the ground was rumbling and the building was falling. "Oh, shit." he

And bodies still line the streets. People still die. The infected still roam almost 3 decades later. At first, long ago; people thought that the military would help \u2013 and they did, or at least tried to... but in no time, they had all turned into zombies too. So people held out and hoped that the apocalypse would end in a few months, hopefully weeks. But weeks turned into months, months turned into years and finally into decades. Of course, it didn\u0027t.\n\n[ci] And now, instead of hoping for the apocalypse to end, people hope to make it through the day. They pray to whatever God looks down on them to keep them safe... safe from the infected, safe from other survivors who do evil deeds, safe from infection, safe from starvation and thirst... anything could happen.\n\n[c] [\ud835\udc0c\ud835\udc0e\ud835\udc11\ud835\udc04 - \ud835\udc0f\ud835\udc0b\ud835\udc04\ud835\udc00\ud835\udc12\ud835\udc04 \ud835\udc11\ud835\udc04\ud835\udc00\ud835\udc03 | http://aminoapps.com/p/yyfy6n ]\n\n[c]\u300c\ud835\ude72\ud835\ude84\ud835\ude81\ud835\ude81\ud835\ude74\ud835\ude7d\ud835\ude83 \ud835\ude74\ud835\ude85\ud835\ude74\ud835\ude7d\ud835\ude83\ud835\ude82\u300d\n[ci] Time: 10pm\n[ci] Date: Somewhere in early April\n[ci] Season: Spring\n[ci] Weather: Warm and raining lightly \n[ci] \u2718 No events have happened in the role play yet.

She is on a mission to kill the person who murdered her father which has truly destroyed her and damaged her to her core.\n\n[BC] The Enigma \n[C] [Cho, 23, Bisexual, Male|http://aminoapps.com/p/zh423g] \n[CI] Someone who is considered an enigma has a sense of mystery that oozes out of them.

People always told him that he was quiet before all this, so now having lost the people he has, he is practically silent. His expression will almost never shift, and his eyes are always empty. He prefers to be alone as he can\u2019t trust anyone, but he doesn\u2019t even know if he can trust himself anymore.

She couldn\u2019t care less about her surroundings if she was smashing random objects with her bat. People could say she\u2019s a little mental and her logic can be like a druggie\u2019s on ice.  After everything they\u2019ve been through, the male wouldn\u2019t let anyone touch who they hate to admit is more than a friend. They need each other.\n\n[Bc] The Inseperable Twins\n[C] [Eclipse, 18, Bisexual, female|http://aminoapps.com/p/za6kjd]\n[C] [Astra, 18, Homosexual, Male|http://aminoapps.com/p/8zdnk7]\n[CI]The two were at their father\u2019s house when the apocalypse started and being done with the way they were treated and put through, it was no doubt they used him as bait to leave. Immediately they went to their moms but seeing her cold body on the floor they knew they had to stay together. So together they are, never leaving each other\u0027s side and practically being connected by the hip. They scavenge, kill, hide together, It\u0027s worked for a God damn while.

That along with his limited medical skills makes him a good recruit for any team. Though he is saddened. Emotional burdens strike him anywhere he can see.

Happy interactive and peaceful. However some sort of event or repeated events broke their sanity in this twisted world. They no longer are mentally tied to reality and lost in a constant lala land. This typically results in mass fits of severe split personality, extreme warped views on things, and an unusual obsession over something specific that typically pays no real mind to helping to survive. Its practically impossible to know whether or not they are a threat as at any moment they could just snap...\n\n[CB] The Stubborn\n[C] [Theon, 22, bisexual, male|http://aminoapps.com/p/dz1sal]\n[Ci]During these harsh times the male had developed wuite a temper for a certain of things. Growing rather impatient with a lot of stuff along with the irritation of not having that many supplies as he had been alone out on the run, he didn\u0027t mind, but sometimes he really wished for a good convo with a person.

She has an incredibly hard time coming to trust people, and often keeps to herself at all times, knowing she can make it on her own. The violent part of her is that she will make sure any threat to her is immediately gone, and often times goes overboard with the kill. Flesh Eating Person, or not. She carries a wooden baseball bat with crooked nails twisted into it everywhere she goes, and keeps a switchblade on her at all times. She has a high \u201ckill count\u201d of many things. The dead, the living, anything that could have tried to kill her. \n\n[BC]The Observant One\n[C][Benjamin, 22, bisexual, male|http://aminoapps.com/p/gr23t2]\n[IC] Even when nobody\u0027s watching, there\u0027s always someone watching, a steady eye is a good one~\n\n[BC]The Loner\n[C][Emani, 21, Asexual, Female | http://aminoapps.com/p/c7e6fp]\n[IC]The aftermath of the rapid widespread of the infection left every last one of Emani\u0027s companions dead.

She had the tendency to switch between joyful and caring, to phyco in a matter of minutes.

No matter what she\u2019s always going to help people, even if it costs her.\n\n[BC]The Skill-full Wanderer\n[C][Quill Marston, 32, Straight, Male|http://aminoapps.com/p/ldx69d8]\n[CI]Being raised by an ex-militia comedian, Quill is very determined to get as  far as he can, acquire what he needs and very jokingly while he\u2019s at it. He\u2019s a funny and skilled person who is always listening to music from his MP3 player. He\u2019s known as the wanderer because he\u2019s always wandering around and alone, he hasn\u2019t let himself get too close to people due to circumstance and doesn\u2019t take anything from anyone.\n\n[BC]The Gambler\n[C][Marcus, 19, bisexual, male|http://aminoapps.com/p/q0gdlj]\n[CI]In the apocalypse, everything is a gamble to Marcus. A risk-taker, Marcus will take a chance which could result in himself getting hurt. With his anxiety, he\u2019s always on his toes. He will never truly trust something or someone, as he doesn\u2019t know everything there is about it. A kevlar vest can be found buckled under his hoodie, but provides no protection. He just wears it to feel safe. A revolver can be found in his pocket, and some spare bullets can be found jingling in the other. If coming out on top meant putting a gun to his head, he\u2019d do it in a heartbeat.\n\n[B][Ci]The Sadist. \n[Ci][Norton Campbell, 28, Bi-Sexual/Bi-Romantic, Male. |http://aminoapps.com/p/iisod4l]\n[Ci]Ever since the event of the world, he grew more..apathetic, more cold, more willing to watch others suffer as he smiled within. He had always shown his dislike for the world, how the greed of others made him almost die within the darkness of a mineshaft, how no one went to look for him, he was left to rot, so it\u0027s only far if others feel the same. \n\n[BIC]The Hermit\n[IC][Antonio, 26, Straight , Male| http://aminoapps.com/p/h5fftq]\n[IC]Antonio was a pretty quiet and chill person before the apocalypse happened. He has his moments of humour and fun. He has been surviving so far by calculating his moves and being cautious. He prefers using weapons that aren\u2019t load and always is just trying to find a place to relax. When tough times come knocking at deaths door he can be brutal and let all the anger out that he keeps in. He is only human and he has accepted that they aren\u2019t \n\n[BIC]The warrior\n[IC][Graham, 26, Straight, male|http://aminoapps.com/p/kdkqb5]\n[IC]Graham enjoys a good fight, but he hates an unfair fight. He keeps it respectful and honorable. He always gives you a choice if you want to fight or not.\n\n[BC]The Mute\n[C][Eden, 23, Bi, Male|http://aminoapps.com/p/l0lrru ]\n[CO]Eden was born unable to talk, communicating primarily by writing on a notebook he carried around, due to a lack of interest in learning sign language. On the bright side, it severely helps when it comes to staying quiet while sneaking groups of things he wants to avoid, mixed with his speed and nimble size.\n\n[bc]The Dane\n[C][Kaenen, 36, Heterosexual, Male|http://aminoapps.com/p/mke9uo]\n[ic]Kaenen or Kane as some come to call him is from the once bustling city in Denmark, Copenhagen. Now it\u0027s no longer an expat hub, it\u0027s a zombieland. He has travelled long and has killed many and this is not limited to the infected. With his sarcasm and blatancy he adds a bit of comic relief to any situation but has a dark side and will not hesitate to protect himself no matter the circumstances.\n\n[BC]The Red\n[C][Kim, 25, Heterosexual, female |http://aminoapps.com/p/554j85z]\n[IC]Kim, more familiarly known as \"Red\", is a solitary survivor. Once reigned with a small town of people, but due to well, infected, that was sure not to last.

Not particularly brutal, but not someone that will be your best friend either. Typically wears some form of mask to conceal their identity.\n\n[BC]The Unfriendly \n[C][Miguel, 25, Bisexual, Male |http://aminoapps.com/p/1forui]\n[Ic]Miguel is not the person you\u0027d like to encounter in a place like this. Aloof , insensitive , sarcastic. There are many words that could describe the way he is but only one reason why. Equal strength , equal brains. Some might find him aggravating but that only makes him more determined to ruin their day. If somehow someone\u0027s managed to get him to behave , he\u0027s a whole new person. \n\n[Cb]The Hoarder.\n[Ci][Sylar Ashford, 36, Bisexual, Male|http://aminoapps.com/p/j170hi]\n[Ci]Being the sadistic and straight up crazy person he is, Sylar collects junk, everything with absolutley no use such as coins, action figures, basically everything. He gives some of those objects a use though and makes noise machines, stuff that will draw away the zombies attention and give them a chance at survival..or he will use them to bring the zombies to others, just to watch them suffer.\n\n[BIC]The maniac\n[Jerome, 17, Pansexual/Demisexual, Male | http://aminoapps.com/p/owsuep]\nJerome is a psychopath, whos main goal is to make everyone crazy, and maybe make a few new friends to help him do that, he enjoys making people go insane, like him, the maniacs are for people like him, who are insane and psychopathic. \n\n[CB]The Insolent\n[C][Blu, 19, Panromantic/Asexual, Non-binary|http://aminoapps.com/p/06ggrl]\n[CI]Blu is sassy and a bit egotistical. They won\u2019t take shit from anyone and their respect has to be earned. Respect is something Blu doesn\u2019t try to earn let alone give. They often will make claims and argue, and they can definitely argue. They\u2019re manipulative and can usually get their way, especially considering how useful they can be due to their skills in technology as well as their great agility.\n\n[CB]The Scavenger\n[C][Jason, 24, Straight, Male |http://aminoapps.com/p/ipdfte]\n[Ci]As a Scavenger, Guss is constantly on the move, looking for a little or a lot. Anything he can grab safely. He has a low risk high reward approach to most scenarios, and would prefer to be in control of all of his encounters.\n\n[bc]The Ecstatic One\n[c][Siko, 18, Straight, male | http://aminoapps.com/p/0ciy3t]\n[ci]He is crazy. He gets excited from seeing hopelessness in people so he often \"plays\" around with people.

After the murder he had a mental break down , all of his personalities had wanted to take control and from his guilt sadness lust and despair the worst of them all took charge, despair. Now he hides out helping those who have felt the touch of pain and desire , but his help doesn\u0027t last long as his murderous tendances come without warning...\n\n[bc]The Empathic \n[c][Prilly, 25, Homosexual, Male | http://aminoapps.com/p/ayr0hs]\n[ci]Throughout the apocalypse Prilly has remained mostly. He was apart of groups in the past but they died. Now he makes his way throughout the desolate cities and towns alone. This was by choice, when around people he had urges, violent urges he finds impossible to control. No matter how hard he tried. So he thought it best to stay away from people, and go it alone, despite the mental toll this has taken. \n\n[bc]The drunk \n[c][Juliet, 22, bisexual, female|http://aminoapps.com/p/4bib99]\n[ci]After the horrible horrific death of her sister, she had nothing else to live for. But yet she didn\u0027t die. So alcohol became her new fixation.

At the age of fourteen, large scale breach by a horde of infected decimated the survivors, resulting in the deaths of Tommy\u0027s parents. Having escaped during the chaos, the boy stole one of the few cars his group had maintained and drove away from the small town where they his group fell to ruin. Three years later and the gas in the car had run out and he travels through the cities on foot, though he has more than gathered enough supplies to do this at least somewhat safely. \n\n[Bc]The Searching\n[C][Sofie Malroon, 19, Straight, Female | http://aminoapps.com/p/wba6mva]\n[iC]Born post-apocalypse, Sofie never got to know what the world before was like. All she knew were stories, stories of what the world was like beforehand. Since her aunt died she has been wandering around the world, looking for something, even if she herself doesn\u2019t know what it is. Maybe it\u2019s closure from those she has lost, or to meet others so she can hear their stories. Though she has lost a lot she continues to hope, and smile despite all the terrible things that have happened. \n\n[BC]The Silent\n[C][Jung-Hoon, 15, Asexual, Male|http://aminoapps.com/p/voulh2 ]\n[IC]He doesn\u0027t usually interact with anyone else besides his father-figure.

She\u0027s silent, but deadly. Growing up in the pandemic since she was 4 has been rough. Her family had taught her everything. How to fight, work weapons, hunt, cook, and even heal herself. She\u0027s learned how to make medicine, but finding the ingredients to make such things is like finding water in the desert. Axel lives ubove the ground. She stays in high places, but always keeps her guard up. She\u0027s not at all weak, and over thinks everything. Normally an over thinker would be a bad thing, but she\u0027s already planned her plan A, B, C, D, E, and F. \n\n[BIC]The watcher\n[IC][Danaya bollan,female,17, | http://aminoapps.com/p/qg29hd]\n[IC]All of Danayas life she had always sat and watched from afar.

Yaamir wouldn\u0027t  call himself a victim to it since he enjoys the men with dagger smiles and their praise. He lack parental affection leading to this once of kindness he gives anyone who crosses his path. The neglect made his caution  relevant and hard to ignore. Majority  of his work is done solo, much preferred to stay that way. Born during the apocalypse and was the main cause of his mother\u0027s  death after the woman developed postpartum depression  and couldn\u0027t  bare his existence, adopted into a small group who had a inner circle zombie outbreak now having him wandering by himself\n\n[c] \u300c\ud835\ude75\ud835\ude7e\ud835\ude81\ud835\ude7c\u300d\n[ci] Not centered so it\u0027s easier to copy\n\nRole
